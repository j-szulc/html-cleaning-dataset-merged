<h3>It's hot, but that doesn't stop the knitting</h3>

<p>Los Angeles used to get cool at night. No matter how hot it got during the day, the nights were always cool and crisp. </p>

<p>This weather forecast tells a lie:</p>

<p><img alt="weatherphoto09102012.jpg" src="http://www.crazyauntpurl.com/archives/images/blog/weatherphoto09102012.jpg" width="420" height="315" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>YES, it really is that hot during the day, but I have yet to see anything with a 6 in front of it for a low. Those lows are a cruel lie. The coolest temperature recorded in my neighborhood this month was 74, just before dawn a few days ago.</p>

<p>Where did my Los Angeles go?  I want my chilly September evenings back!</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I knit onward and upward. Turn up your A/C, friends, because you're still getting hand-knit gifts from the person who takes pictures of her TV weather forecast. Nothing weird at all about that.</p>

<p>Corey, modeling her summertime arm warmers:</p>

<p><img alt="corey-armwarmers1.jpg" src="http://www.crazyauntpurl.com/archives/images/blog/corey-armwarmers1.jpg" width="420" height="315" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p><img alt="corey-armwarmers2.jpg" src="http://www.crazyauntpurl.com/archives/images/blog/corey-armwarmers2.jpg" width="420" height="430" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>These armwarmers were knit using Rowan All Seasons Cotton yarn in a variegated pink colorway. I used a size 8 needle, tight knitters can I get a what what! I don't remember how many stitches I cast on. Just start with a swatch and it will work out.</p>

<p><img alt="coreyarmwarmers-pinkfabric.jpg" src="http://www.crazyauntpurl.com/archives/images/blog/coreyarmwarmers-pinkfabric.jpg" width="420" height="315" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p><img alt="coreyarmwarmers-seaming.jpg" src="http://www.crazyauntpurl.com/archives/images/blog/coreyarmwarmers-seaming.jpg" width="420" height="315" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>Once you have the piece long as you like it, seam up the long sides, leaving a little opening for a thumb. SO EASY.</p>

<p><img alt="coreyarmwarmers-seed-stitch.jpg" src="http://www.crazyauntpurl.com/archives/images/blog/coreyarmwarmers-seed-stitch.jpg" width="420" height="315" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p>

<p>For a little decoration (and to keep the piece polished at the top) I started with a few rows of seed stitch. I love the look of seed stitch finishing anything, a scarf, a hat or a mitten. </p>

<p>I have several armwarmer orders on my to-knit Christmas list, along with a couple of slouchy hats. My personal Christmas wish is that it gets COLD this winter and I get a chance to wear some of the hand-knit goodness stockpiled in my closet.</p>

<p>What's on your holiday knitting to-do list?</p>

<p>And where are you hiding the weather machine that makes the cool nights?</p>

<p>Ha!  60's for a low when your high is above 100 is delusional!  When we had 100's this summer our lows were in the 80's. (Washington DC). We have the cool weather machine now and we're not giving it back!</p>

<p>Today hasn't broken 70 yet, so I'm pretty sure we have the cool weather machine and it is on all the time.</p>

<p>I started work on my holiday presents yesterday, starting with the project I wasn't able to finish last year. Here is hoping that I didn't put it off too long to get it done (and some others) this year.</p>

<p>I agree with Ellen.  I live in Pittsburgh, PA and our lows now are in the 50's, highs in the 80's this week.  No more 100's for us...  P.S. we are sharing the cool weather machine.</p>

<p>OMG!! christmas knitting! YIKES!  We are planning to move to RENO, hopefully BEFORE christmas, so I will be cold-winter-land, and I can wear all the sweaters, socks, hats, scarves that I have knit and are collecting dust in my drawer. but I digress, I haven't even begun to think about christmas knitting!<br />

<p>Well, come north, my dear.  I left Arcadia and the San Gabriel Valley behind when I graduated from high school long, long ago.  I remember many nights between July and October when it was 75 in our screened patio where we often went to sleep when it was 85-90 plus degrees inside the house with no A/C. Up here by the SF Bay, it is very rarely above 65 at night, and when we have a hot spell, I head on up to my son's place in Eureka where the average summertime HIGH is 61 degrees.  (Good knitting weather up there all year round!)</p>

<p>Here in Atlanta, we have finally cooled to something below "my ass is on fire" degrees.  Low 80's, low 60's at night, and rock bottom humidity.  Not that flaming temps have stopped me.  I currently have 27 cowls and 15 sets of armwarmers (from one of your posts)stashed in my closet.  I have no idea who is going to wear all of this.  Last year I had my winter coats cleaned and never wore them - not once all winter.  If there is one thing to say about me, it's that once I commit, I am in it.  Obsession, ya know?</p>

<p>I have been working really hard to finish or rip out all my works in progress. There are so many that I still have to buy needles anytime I want to knit something new so I've been trying to knock things out. </p>

<p>Knitting, my own version of hording.</p>

<p>I have finished a couple of scarves, one is a chunky infinity scarf which is seen in all the stores right now so I am taking advantage of it and look like one of the cool kids. I am also just finishing up my All Seasons blanket. I've been "working" on this for a couple of years now. </p>

<p>I probably won't knit any presents other than some socks for the women in my family. Most of the family lives in Arizona or Central California where it just doesn't get all that cold. My poor British relatives have more handknits than they will ever be able to wear out. I'll give them a break this year.</p>

<p>Sorry, the cool weather is in Indiana right now (50's last night, brrr!).    I want to do slippers for my great-niece & great-nephew (both two) and I need a small car seat blanket for a new great-niece due in November (I finally started it last weekend!).  I think that's it for holiday/birthday knitting.</p>

<p>Really pretty knitting!  Reminds me of mints, or ribbon candy.  Nice that you've got a willing model, too!  I knit a hat (as a pattern-tester, not for anyone in particular)about two years ago and have yet to get a 3D image of it.  Like with a head inside it.</p>

<p>I continue to knit socks and then more socks.  I can't explain it.  No matter what I cast on, including swatches, just seems to morph into a sock.</p>

<p>Christmas knitting!  Augghhh!  Two pairs of men's socks, a shoulder shawl/scarf, a hat, and something for my mother but I don't know what to make her!  That last one has me worried.  Sounds like you have a handle on things, and the arm warmers are so pretty!  (Btw, I like seed stitch, too.  Much better than garter, which for some reason just looks clunky to me. Just my opinion, folks, don't yell at me.)  </p>

<p>I'm going through my stash and knitting or crocheting hats. Last year I did this as a stash cleanup and mailed a box of hats to a friend of mine who then redistributed them, and I think it went well so I'm doing it again. Most of them are simple beanies, and I don't worry about care instructions because these are going to someone who knows how to care for handknits (and heck, even if they get destroyed in a washing machine, that's what the next hat box is for!). </p>

<p>Knitting ... maybe I can do some more when the S.O. has finished renovating his house, and I get back an hour a day of commute time and stop having to help him with his renovation.  One day.  In the meantime, I've packed up a bunch-o-stuff to make room for him at my place because his place has no kitchen.  I've forgotten what that stuff is ... but I'm hoping it includes the oven roasting pan.  I can't find it anywhere and I wanted to broil something the other day.</p>

<p>Here in New England the nights have been in the 50s lately (after a brutally hot August) and at the first dip in temperature my knitting came out! I've been making socks lately (a pair with that nifty variegated yarn that I call "Fair Isle for Dummies" and a pair of swirled tube socks).  My Christmas knitting list is fairly sock-heavy:  tube socks, regular socks, bed socks, crocheted 'fan' bookmarks, a shawl, and a hat.  Not too ambitious but at least I'm thinking about it in September and not the day after Thanksgiving.<br />
I adore your blog and never fail to laugh and cry and wonder "Who ARE those people??" with you. Take care!  </p>

<p>Our cool weather machine has only been working in fits & starts.  Doesn't matter, as I knit on anyway!  I'm considering arm warmers this year, as the go-to giftable for the holidays.  I've done hats & cowls, and nothing at all (some years it just can't be borne...), but no-one at work seems to mind anyway.  So, I'll likely work up about 8-9 pairs of arm-warmers, but only work on those when some other knitting is kicking my assets.</p>

<p>After MONTHS and MONTHS of hot, dry weather (in the 100's, and no rain at all - - we are right in the middle of the severe drought portion of the country) we are finally starting to get some decent temps. Upper 70's to mid-80's during the day, 50's at night. And blessed, blessed rain!</p>

<p>So if you don't mind, I would like to hang on to the weather machine just a bit longer, just until we get the water levels back up to where my well doesn't run dry.....</p>

<p>Finally picked up my crochet needle after a long break from it...having a passion right now for making hats!  I made a razorback hat (I live in Arkansas...we are the razorbacks) this weekend as a gift for a friend having a baby...it turned out so cute and she loves it.  So thinking my grandkids will be getting hats for Christmas. Fall blew in here last Sat!  After temps in the 100s all last week, a storm blew thru Friday and it's been wonderful ever since...highs in the 80s and lows in the 60s.  What a relief from a LONG hot, scary dry, miserable summer!</p>

The winter's project is my first-ever pair of socks.  I completed one toe last winter and then lost the bag.  It's turned up again, so here I go!  <br />
Thanks for pointing me towards variegated yarn - you were right, and it really does hide everything.  Call it Febreeze for a novice knitter.  (I can't knit at an even tension yet and I'm doing socks!)</p>

<p>Hi Laurie,<br />
My last Christmas knitting wasn't finished on time. I wrapped the size 35 needles and pile of cream colored yarn into a box with a bow. When my Dad opened the box everyone had a what the ... moment until they realized it was an afgan (4 strands knit into a box pattern, kind of like your magic scarf pattern). That was a long time ago, but the afgan lives on in my brothers house, still a comfort to all that snuggle under it. If I knit a wearable for anyone I need a label that says yes I made it, no you can't return it.</p>

<p>It is finally cooler (and beautiful) here in VA. I actually had to get up during the night and close the window! When I lived in the LA area a few years ago, I was shocked every summer (April-Nov) that I had to ADD 10 degrees to the tv temps for LA to get the real temp for our valley. And about knitting gifts? I made myself a scarf (I usually always knit for others)but when I tried it on I realized it is way to scratchy to wear near my skin. Sigh. So I am pulling out the sewing machine for Christmas gifts. I am disillusioned with knitting these days. No one can appredaite the work that goes into a nice present unless they knit themselves. And if they knit themselves, they can make the simple hat or scarf that I am capable of. </p>

<p>My easy-peasy gift for my peeps everywhere is coffee/beer/coke coziness, knitted just like a ribbed sweater cuff. Make 'em in leftover superwash worsted. Extra points if you overdye fugly colors with koolaid and get that stuff outta your stash.</p>

<p>Or if it's too hot for hats where you live, knit some washable hats in dark colors and send em to a homeless shelter someplace cold. Or make smaller, bright-colored versions and send them to a school in a poor neighborhood. Everyone should have hand knitted goodness at least once.</p>

<p>The weather here in LA, it is a little-known fact, is the fault of my friend Loretta in NYC. She came out in July, when LA was still was LA (unseasonably cool, even, delightful to me). She complained, "Where is the high heat and low humidity LA is famous for? I love heat!" </p>

<p>Then she went back to NYC, and BAM! that's when it hit. She didn't come out to visit -- she came out to hex us, and plop some of her NY heat and humidity on us. I've begged, threatened, bribed with knitted goods (scarf, hat, and mitts), to get her to come take it back, to no avail. </p>

Very simple, hopefully very quick, and not a)hats or b)cowls (which I've done to death).  Not holding my breath for the next post, but will look forward to it just the same! </p>

<p>Great arm warmers! Really cool stuff. I am amazed with both it's functionality and stylish. Many leg warmers can even be converted for arm wear, versatile for changeable conditions. Simple yet effective. </p>
