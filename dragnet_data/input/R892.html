							<div class="description">
								<p>For those who remember, in 2011, I embarked on a <a href="http://ayeartotenpercent.com">challenge</a>. The goal was to get to 10% body fat in one year. I spent the entire year working out and watching what I ate. I also spent a ton of time bitching about it, but that&#8217;s to be expected.</p>
<p><img src="http://shankman.com/wp-content/uploads//difference1-300x198.jpg" alt="" title="difference1" width="300" height="198" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4596" />The end result was pretty awesome: I dropped a ton of weight, a ton of fat, added a ton of muscle, and in general, felt much, much better. Then, I got married, and 2012 started. With the challenge over, with no blog to update anymore, with no <i>accountability</i> in my life, the gym took a back seat to my business traveling, my work, my TV appearances, and the like. Eating healthy went from &#8220;eating healthy&#8221; to &#8220;trying to eat healthy,&#8221; to &#8220;trying not to eat like complete shit,&#8221; to &#8220;screw it, I&#8217;ll hit seamless.com.&#8221; I forgot everything I learned, I forgot how good it felt to be totally drained after a good workout, I forgot what it was like to beat new numbers, lift more than before, and I forgot the rewards that came living like that.</p>
<p>And guess what? I&#8217;m heavy again. And I&#8217;m really, really angry with myself.</p>
<p>I went with my dad this morning to a nutritionist, where I found out that I&#8217;d basically put back almost everything I lost last year. I know my fat to muscle ratio has changed significantly as well. I don&#8217;t even need the scale to tell me this, I know how my clothes feel.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m miserable. I&#8217;m so unhappy about this, I have been for a few months, and yet, until this morning, I haven&#8217;t done anything about it. I don&#8217;t know why. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s so much harder to drop the weight this time than it was a year ago. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m back to eating like shit, and I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve seen this, and haven&#8217;t been able to stop it until now.</p>
<p>I do know though that I&#8217;m miserable, I&#8217;m incredibly angry with myself, and probably most importantly, it&#8217;s <strong>entirely my fault.</strong> I have no one else to blame for this.</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s the point I&#8217;m at &#8211; When you realize that it is in fact yourself who did this to you, it makes it that much harder to swallow, but perhaps that&#8217;s where your &#8220;bottom&#8221; is. Once you realize that there&#8217;s no one else to blame, you know it&#8217;s your fault, and you know you have to make the hard choices to fix it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4599" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 177px"><img src="http://shankman.com/wp-content/uploads//non-oval-167x300.jpg" alt="" title="non-oval" width="167" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-4599" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A year ago, my head was oval. :(</p></div>Well, I guess I&#8217;ve hit rock bottom here. Not in a &#8220;arrested while driving drunk and running into a building&#8221; bottom, but certainly something, in my mind, close to as bad. I&#8217;ve become, yet again, a slug, and I hate myself for it.</p>
<p>I think I needed to realize that it was entirely my fault before I was ready to do something about it. So now I am. I&#8217;ve let myself get to this place, and I know what it&#8217;s like to be here, for I&#8217;ve been here before. It&#8217;s a terrible place. I need to get out immediately, and I need to fix it. So I will. It&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>We make time for what&#8217;s important to us, and we don&#8217;t for what&#8217;s not. I learned that last year. If we want something bad enough, we find the time for it. &#8220;I have no time for the gym,&#8221; is bullshit. If we want it, we&#8217;ll make the time. See those people who, from 5am to 6am have the time to workout? It&#8217;s not that they like getting up at 4am, it&#8217;s that working out is important to them, so they make it a priority.</p>
<p>I guess it hasn&#8217;t been important enough to me for the last eleven months. And I have no one to blame for that but myself. Not my wife, not my assistant, not my cat. Just me.</p>
<p>Perhaps we all need to realize that the majority of shit we get ourselves into is in fact, our fault. Perhaps if we all manned up more, we&#8217;d be better off, instead of blaming everyone and everything else around us. I know it&#8217;s easier to do that, but then, you can&#8217;t start improving until you admit there&#8217;s a problem, and if you&#8217;re blaming everyone else for it, then you aren&#8217;t admitting that the problem is you.</p>
<p>The problem is me. I see that now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to change that.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>

I&#8217;m back at the heavy point too after losing over 30 pounds in 2009. I did a 150 bike ride that year, a triathlon and was feeling great. For me eating well and working out is a lifestyle. I realized in 2003 when I ran my first marathon that diet was absolutely everything given my metabolism. I guess I&#8217;m not angry enough but I need to get my ass in gear. </p>
<p>Good luck and I&#8217;ll follow your progress. Maybe an accountability partner may help. Lord knows I need one and a gym rat to work out with.</p>

Maybe if you go more slowly this time, really try to change your habits, it will stay off.  Seems like last time you lost it kinda fast.  Slow down, bring healthy snacks with you everywhere, make sure you walk or do some activity everyday.  You know all of this, I&#8217;m sure, but a reminder that it stays off better when you truly change your habits never hurt.  And you need a &#8220;treat&#8221; from time to time, just make it a small portion and don&#8217;t eat treats before you eat a meal cause you&#8217;ll overdo it.</p>

And I agree &#8211; sometimes we can push ourselves to a one-off goal, but changing an entire way of living takes&#8230;well&#8230;a lifetime.  I did the same thing once where I ate well and lost weight but didn&#8217;t really change the way I lived my life&#8230;so feel free to go at it a little slower: oddly enough it seems to get longer-term results if you don&#8217;t go 200% drastic.  (But then, &#8220;200% Drastic&#8221; or &#8220;0% Screw This&#8221; seem to be the two ways in which you work! So, I guess it&#8217;s back to drastic!!)</p>

<p>By the way, accountability is a key thing. Why don&#8217;t you schedule a status update that tells your fans: &#8220;Please Check with me if I&#8217;m still going to gym/eating healthy. This message was scheduled on nov 2012&#8230; I need YOU to hold me accountable. Please post to my wall and ask me if I&#8217;m following through! Thank you&#8221;</p>
<p>Lol, you can be sure people WILL check on you. That could work wonders.</p>
<p>Another thing is to write checks to a political party you hate and tell a friend to deposit them there if you don&#8217;t go to the gym.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; this is some advice I need to tell myself more.</p>

<p>I go through the same thing &#8212; its why I continue to sign up for triathlons, not because they are crazy fun, but because the only thing that gives me the discipline to work out on a (sometiems semi-)regular basis is knowing I&#8217;m going to either hurt-like-hell or look-like-an-idiot come race day if I don&#8217;t get my ass out of bed early for the ride/swim/run/whatever.

You can spend it running (I&#8217;d been faithfully doing 8 miles/day) or spend it with the kid.&#8221; Last day I ran was the day before the kid was born. I love the kid like mad, but I&#8217;d love to be slimmer too. So it goes.</p>

I&#8217;ve lost 30 pounds in the last 4 months and I&#8217;ve been running 4 days a week. It feels awesome. But I realized that I couldn&#8217;t set short-term goals or I would quit when I reached them. I had to come to the realization that health is a lifelong commitment. When I shifted my mindset to this, it changed my entire view of living a healthy life. I blogged about this idea a little bit here: <a href="http://johncade.com/whats-your-personal-health-paradigm/" rel="nofollow">http://johncade.com/whats-your.....-paradigm/</a></p>

I so totally relate to your experience and efforts &#8211; having lost and gained hundreds of pounds throughout my life. I may not be the best example of success.  But what I do understand is that to lose weight and keep it off, one must find a way of eating and exercising that becomes a way of life &#8211; not just changing habits in an extreme way to lose weight, only to find that the weight slowly creeps back on once we get back to what&#8217;s real. What&#8217;s important today may not be as important tomorrow if other things get in the mix.  However, if we can eat and maintain healthy movement that fits into a daily or weekly routine, then we may be able to stay on a road to success, even if at times we have to re-navigate our way.  Thanks for sharing your story Peter!</p>

I understand your perspective and often take a similar hard line with myself but I have some concerns about the black and white view of taking full responsibility for something you&#8217;re unhappy with. Clearly you are not alone in your struggle with weight and our culture is not particularly helpful. As a dietitian, recovering alcoholic, and meditator (and someone who has kept off almost 50 pounds of excess weight for the better part of 20 years) I am aware of the importance of acknowledging challenges and practicing mindfulness, being aware of what&#8217;s happening in your body and mind in order to make skillful choices, whether related to diet and exercise or the million other things that end up having an effect on your weight in the long run. Wishing you luck and am more than happy to connect about mindfulness and weight issues. ~Jenna (<a href="http://drinkingtodistraction.com" rel="nofollow">http://drinkingtodistraction.com</a>)</p>

I&#8217;ve been doing it for 2+ years and it&#8217;s incredible. So easy to stick with. Not an everlasting struggle like other diet/weight loss plans. Try it for 30 days and I guarantee you&#8217;ll never look back. </p>

Now our eating habits are healthy, we have lost close to 30 pounds combined, and we will be able to live longer and be with our son. Good luck, you CAN do it for real this time.</p>

<p>My best friend has a similar story, and I&#8217;m wondering if you have any advice for motivating/helping her get back to eating healthy and exercising. I really want to see her happy with herself. </p>
<p>She has always struggled with her weight and lost about 90 pounds last year and was really into eating well and working out (she even did a triathlon) , but now that she has a new job in a high-power position, she is back to almost zero exercise and little control over what she eats. I truly believe that physical health goes hand in hand with mental health, and I want all the best for her.</p>
<p>What do you suggest we do to hold ourselves (and others) accountable? You&#8217;re right in that the change must start with YOU and within.</p>

<p>I was down below 180 pounds at the beginning of the summer. That was the least I&#8217;d weighed for at least a dozen years. The only reason that weight initially came off was stress from a REALLY CRAPPY job. That job came to and end, and nine months of unemployment came with it. Still, with plenty of yard work and bikes rides both on and off the trainer, I managed to keep the weight off when I very well could have bloated out of shape simply out of laziness or depression. </p>
<p>Then, I let it all slip away. I could blame vacation or a new job, but the onus of why I&#8217;m now well above 190 rests completely on me.</p>

Personal accountability is where it&#8217;s at in all things, from your own health and appearance, to your marketing and communication plan.  I was inspired to start down the road to better health and eating based on your original blog!  Perhaps the extreme nature of your goals was part of the need to release after it was done?  Certainly the stress of a wedding contributes to that feeling of a pinnacle.  But as you suggest, these are just excuses.  I suggest embracing the life-long challenge with a more moderate goal, and also creating accountability TO others &#8212; an actual group that meets is the very best, but a virtual version of that can work too via social media or blogging if that is easier for you.  Take it one &#8220;good habits&#8221; day at a time:)  Thanks for continuing to inspire with honesty.  &#8211;Beth</p>

Why not trying being gentle on yourself, working a little less and taking care of yourself a little more? It&#8217;s what people in less sick and crazy cultures do&#8230;and having lived in one of them and adapted it to my life in the U.S., it works. I&#8217;m a much happier, self-loving person. How about a little self-compassion, allowing room to live a human life and not be perfect all the time? I&#8217;ll be at the gym at 5:30 today, and YES, that always makes me feel so much better. But you won&#8217;t hear me publicly decrying myself on busier or less disciplined days. It&#8217;s ok to be&#8230;you know&#8230;a normal person, no matter how extraordinary you and your work are.</p>

The upside of your approach is that you learned a lot about how your body will respond to nutritional and exercise changes.  And while the 10% goal was laudable  it may not have been the most sustainable (likewise your diet and exercise regimen to maintain it).  Shooting for more moderate goals in a more sustainable way (one that you can share with your wife) may be your best bet to reaching your ultimately objective &#8211; long-lasting health.</p>

It&#8217;s all on-the-job training, and who knows what I&#8217;ll learn this time that will help me keep doing what I want to: to be an always better nurse; to live long enough to see my grandson graduate from college; to keep creating an awareness in nursing practice that nuclear guardianship is part of community health nursing. </p>

I&#8217;ll remind you of something you wrote in a previous blog post, and something every single one of use needs to remember every day &#8211; I WILL NOT QUIT. It was your post-Ironman blog post, detailing those excruciating last miles when every fiber in your body and cell in your brain says STOP! But your inner fortitude says, &#8220;believe in yourself, you can do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only you can fuel the fortitude. You CAN do it. I&#8217;m telling myself that too, as I come off an injury and try to train for another marathon. My inner fortitude is the only thing standing between me and the finish line.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t quit. Your life is your marathon!<br />

 think what this points to is something few of us want to accept: You<br />
can&#8217;t do it all. In this uber-multi-tasked world of ours, we foster the<br />
illusion that you can do everything, be everything, be everywhere,<br />
accomplish everything, and the result of all that inane thinking is a<br />
bunch of exhausted, unhappy (and perhaps overweight) people. </p>
<p>If you want to have a life worth living (as opposed to one where you&#8217;re<br />
going balls-to-the-wall 18 hours a day), with enough time to make a good<br />
 living, and HAVE the free time to enjoy it, something&#8217;s gotta give.<br />
Period. Seems simple on the surface, but in this pressure-cooker culture<br />
 of ours, where being considered a &#8220;player&#8221; means working yourself to death (or to<br />
overweight), it takes courage to say, &#8220;Screw it; I don&#8217;t give a s&#8211;t<br />
what the world thinks about my choices, or whether they think I&#8217;m not<br />
&#8216;serious.&#8217; I&#8221;m going to live for me, and my family.&#8221; </p>
<p>Oh, and here&#8217;s a newsflash; the world is actually spending an alarmingly small<br />
amount of time thinking about you. And the day you get that will be your<br />
 own personal Independence Day.</p>

I call myself a &#8216;repeat offender&#8217; because I once lost 49 lbs and then put almost all back on again, over a long period of time.  I was making better food choices, but I wasn&#8217;t exercising enough, wasn&#8217;t watching portions well enough and wasn&#8217;t tracking or getting that accountability you mentioned.  Lost it all again and so can you!  I haven&#8217;t read it yet, but you might want to check out David Kirchoff&#8217;s new book (CEO of Weight Watchers), as he travels all the time too, as you do.  I know you can do it, you just have to wrap your head around it again and sometimes that takes finding the right motivation.</p>

I spent my lifetime being really thin until I got asthma and went on medication.  Now that combined with menopause&#8230;and wine&#8230;and yummy food&#8230;and suddenly at 49 I am significantly larger.  I was one of those irritating people who could eat anything and stay thin.  Now I am not.  On one hand, yes, it&#8217;s my fault.  On the other, my body chemistry has shifted and it&#8217;s harder to lose weight.  I could sit around being sad, but I don&#8217;t have the energy for that.  I&#8217;d rather focus outward.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not thrilled about this larger, fluffier me, but I have decided that I am not stressing out endlessly about my size.  My teen age daughter needs a role model who embraces herself at any size.  So I&#8217;m learning to love the curves and pondering ways to decrease them without going to extremes.  I agree, we have to take responsibility for all of our choices and the consequences of those choices and the reactions and choices we make as a result of the consequences.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe we should all just lighten up a little bit.  Perhaps instead of extreme dieting and extreme bounce back, a little moderation might be the more prudent and long term successful path.  You look great either way.  Give yourself a break.  You didn&#8217;t shoot a puppy, you gained a little weight.  </p>
<p>You rock, Peter Shankman.  That is all.</p>

I think you are so used to excelling at so many things that you are being extra hard on yourself about not excelling at this. You already accomplish like 500% more than the average human being, so it makes sense that some things you will accomplish at peak performance and then other things you will accomplish with a bit of struggle&#8211;you have taken on a lot. By all means attack this problem with renewed vigor, but also don&#8217;t be too hard on yourself. Yes, we must all man up and have accountability for our actions&#8230;but we must also be compassionate with ourselves when we slip up.</p>

A place where he&#8217;s entitled to write about whatever he wants and to share his innermost thoughts and feelings. Not sure why you felt the need to wag a finger at him for being candid and honest about something which has been and always will be a huge personal struggle for him. Comparing this, as you say, &#8220;self-important stuff&#8221; to the catastrophic devastation of Sandy is ridiculous and unwarranted. It&#8217;s one thing if Peter somehow downplayed the suffering of those affected by the hurricane in this blog but he&#8217;s done absolutely nothing of that kind. Conversely, he&#8217;s tweeted and Facebook status updated about helping those who are in need and has donated time and money against the cause of Sandy. So instead of asking him to write a post on perspective, perhaps you should think about it yourself.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-27678" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>So much about weight-gain and lethargy have to do with something called &#8220;sub-clinical malnutrition&#8221;. Sub-clinical malnutrition means you have no disease related condition but that you are affected. In this instance the body is simply not getting, or not absorbing, enough nutrients from food which results in a constant need to eat (usually &#8220;cheap&#8221; sources of energy like simple carbs) as well as a lack of energy for exercise. This lack of energy will show up as psychological resistance. </p>
<p>There are so many reasons we become malnourished &#8211; low gut microflora called probiotics, inflammation, food allergies, low stomach acid (which has identical symptoms to excess stomach acid), stress, poor diet, coffee (which depletes essential minerals) etc. </p>
<p>I have found, in working with my clients, that rather than seek the cause (chasing symptoms), begin to flood the body with the highest quality nutrients possible &#8211; this includes a raw greens powder that includes a broad spectrum of probiotics like Vitamineral Greens, as well as green juices, superfoods like goji berries, bee pollen, and fish oil, and eliminating or minimizing things that antagonize the body like coffee, alcohol, processed foods, and medication. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to say you shouldn&#8217;t feel accountable, but I am saying that very few overweight people are overweight simply due to their habits. Their habits are often driven by hidden factors. Clear up the hidden factors and self-discipline becomes exponentially easier. Don&#8217;t clear them up and you begin a wrestling match with your body&#8217;s primal needs that you simply can&#8217;t win. </p>
<p>There is a video called &#8220;Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead&#8221; you may enjoy.</p>
<p>Best of health to you Peter!</p>

Then all of the zero people who care about your opinions can read it and leave you encouraging comments. Or, you could spend the 30 seconds you spent typing this comment donating to Sandy victims instead, if that&#8217;s so important to you.</p>
<p>When we start playing the game of &#8220;Your problems don&#8217;t matter because other people&#8217;s problems are worse,&#8221; nobody grows, learns, or benefits. Peter doesn&#8217;t get to bitch about his weight because Sandy victims don&#8217;t have electricity? Okay, then Sandy victims don&#8217;t get to bitch about not having power, because people in parts of Africa have NEVER had working electricity. And those people in Africa can&#8217;t bitch either, because people in Syria can&#8217;t even go outside without dodging sniper bullets. And the Syrians don&#8217;t get to bitch either, because there are parts of the world where children are kidnapped, raped, and forced to become child soldiers. Eventually we get to the person with the worst problems on the entire planet, and only THAT person is allowed to complain. Right?</p>
<p>Or we could play a different game, and learn from the fact that all of us who have the ability to comment on this blog are incredibly fucking privileged individuals who need frequent reminders from ourselves and from other people to be grateful for our blessings and to take responsibility for our failures. I like that game better. Although it doesn&#8217;t lend itself as well to comment trolling&#8230;</p>

I can say that most of us have fallen off of some bandwagon and struggled to get back on; I have been struggling for almost 8 years with a challenge which stares me down every morning.  Like you say, it&#8217;s down to me.  We get to decide when the rubber hits the road.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll piggyback onto your realization and offer a challenge: With a loving heart. let&#8217;s do one small thing positive thing differently today, for ourselves; then tomorrow, and see what kind of a reasonable goal sheet we can compose to achieve manageable, short term goals.  Beyond that, then we&#8217;ll talk :)</p>

Running a few miles a day; not training for marathon. Eating healthy 5-6 days a week, eating whatever once or twice. This small stuff makes a big difference. Stick to a low-maintenance, somewhat enjoyable diet/exercise plan instead of the all or nothing that you describe in your post. (Granted, you strike me as an all or nothing person who thrives on intense experiences, so maybe easier said than done for you.)</p>

Your readers can certainly hold you accountable, but I found writing down what I did every day &#8211; what I ate and when, how much exercise I did, how much alcohol I drank &#8211; helped.

Here&#8217;s the good news:</p>
<p>You know YOU CAN DO IT &#8211; you are still fit, functional and healthy. You&#8217;ve done this before, and none of the fundamentals have changed.</p>
<p>You know WHAT WORKS &#8211; Over your year to 10%, you saw what delivered results and what was an exhausting waste of time. You know what workouts motivate you, and which are a beat-down. You know what foods satisfy you, and which just make you hungry.</p>
<p>You know YOURSELF BETTER &#8211; you understand your food triggers, your temptations, your rationalizations. You can see an exuse coming a mile away &#8211; and can sidestep it!</p>
<p>Now, the tough love: This will always be a battle. There is no magic bullet, no new status quo, no new magic setpoint. We&#8217;d love to think that once we achieve the new, lean, fit you, that we can eat with reckless abandon and hold our gains.</p>
<p>Need a place to start? Keep it simple &#8211; goal, formula, inspiration, measurement, results</p>
<p>My goal: like Kevin Spacey&#8217;s character in American Beauty: look good naked! (also in clothes, on the beach). Be seen as a fit person. Have a good amount of vitality &#8211; strength, energy, endurance. (no marathons, &#8217;cause that&#8217;s just crazy).</p>
<p>My formula (your mileage may vary): low carb (red meat, eggs, butter, vegetables, and a little fresh fruit, no sugar, no starches), weights (bench, squats, deadlifts, curls), interval training (spinning, tabata). Pullups, situps, pushups. (hundredpushups.com and twohundredsitups.com have great training plans)</p>
<p>My go-to inspiration: Gary Taube&#8217;s &#8220;What if it&#8217;s all been a big fat lie?&#8221; (article) and Dr. Robert Lustig&#8217;s &#8220;Sugar: The bitter truth&#8221; (video). These keep me fervently believing in low-carb. (I believe that your results are mostly 80% of what goes in your mouth. Exercise makes you strong and have endurance, but isn&#8217;t the silver bullet for weight loss)</p>
<p>My measurement: on the scale, every morning, logged on my iPad. Even when I don&#8217;t want to. Fearlessly looking in the mirror after I shower. Which pants fit.</p>
<p>My results: At least 35 lbs consistently kept off, cholesterol down 100 points, never hungry. Levis 514 Straight Slim with 32 waist. And a 46th post-workout shirtless birthday photo that can happily call the &#8220;after&#8221; picture.<br />
Peter, you aren&#8217;t alone &#8211; and I know the feeling of helplessness and despair and self-loathing all too well. I know I&#8217;m only a cheat, a binge and a lazy week away from being where you are today. It sucks to find yourself where you are today.</p>
<p>But dammit, you&#8217;re Peter Shankman. You can do this.</p>

May I suggest an exercise to put it all in perspective? Ask yourself if you&#8217;d be this angry with a dear friend who&#8217;d just gone through the same sequence of events. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, you wouldn&#8217;t be angry &#8211; you&#8217;d be compassionate, and might even offer constructive advice (like some of the advice you&#8217;ve received below from compassionate online friends). Can you try to give yourself some of that same compassion and understanding? It might help you relax and focus better on what you need to do to restore your health and appropriate weight.</p>
<p>All the best, Peter. I enjoy HARO and I enjoy your blog. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

Be kind to yourself and realize that you are probably a carer, a comforter, a giver and you turned those same instincts on yourself, even if it was detrimental to your health. Good luck, being able to honestly appraise the toughest truths requires bravery and the only path to true healing.</p>
