<p>Anything for this hero.  Come on people think of the reason why you are doing it, for a man who gave his all for us.  If you cant suck it up for 10 miles then you are weak and feable minded.  And dont forget why you have a 3 day weekend.  It's Veterans day.  </p>

<p>Awesome. Love crossfit always taking you past your percieved limits. Running is my weakness and does anyone like burpees. This will literally take me almost two hours. I ship out for basic in February so I guess I better get used to running. Thank you Clovis and I will be thinking of your sacrifice during the 10 miles and 150 burpees.</p>

<p>Sunday musings…</p>

<p>1) Obfuscate. To lie, just better dressed. </p>

<p>2) Veteran’s Day. Today we remember all of those who have served our country in the Armed Forces. Or, do we? Think about it…when is the last time you actually thought about what it meant for someone you know or knew to serve in our military? Your Dad, an uncle, your sister, or the couple across the street who are now wearing Dockers instead of Dress Blues. All of the CrossFitters who will retire this year, like Paul, Andy, Tosh. </p>

<p>What sort of recognition do you really have of their service? How exactly will you express that?</p>

<p>3) Childhood. Mrs. bingo and I used to whisper in our children’s ear each night: “you’re having a happy childhood.” They have no memory of these whispered exhortations, but they did have very happy childhoods, indeed. </p>

<p>When does childhood end? It’s certainly not the beginning of school. Judging by my experiences it most certainly isn’t in college, either! Perhaps it’s that first job, or the first time you pay the rent out of your own checkbook, or pull out a couple of bucks to tip whoever. The birth of your first child is certainly a wake-up call; maybe that’s when your own childhood concludes. Mrs. bingo and I always said we’d consider ourselves grown-ups when we owned our own washer and dryer. </p>

<p>Could it be, though, that childhood never ends? I think of friends, a few much older patients, others who have never lost that child-like sense of wonder at the world around them. For sure, some folks are forced to grow up much too quickly and take on the responsibilities we associate with the end of childhood when the calendar says that they are much too young to be considered an adult. But is even their childhood truly over? </p>

<p>All childhood really does end, of course. We do, eventually, all move on to something that looks like all grown up. But our childhood remains there for us, all of the wonder of discovery, all of the memories, all of the people who brought us up. It’s all still there, ready to be called upon when we need a little boost, when we need to remember who and why we are, to feel again what it felt like to have few responsibilities and fewer cares. It gets a little better as we get a little older, too, doesn’t it? Childhood memories seem to be wired that way.</p>

<p>You are never too old to have a happy childhood. </p>

<p>I’ll see you next week...<br />

<p>don't be dumb about this WOD if you need to scale it then scale it thats what CrossFit is all about maybe do half maybe do 3/4 who knows do what your body can do dont push to be injured and don't listen to the people saying if you can't do it then your weak minded because thats not the answer either. train smart and hard not stupid and dangerous. for the record ill be doing 4 miles to 100 burpees</p>

<p>Total time (including 7 min rest) 1:43:59</p>

<p>I don't have a pull-up bar outside high enough for burpee pull-ups and it was pouring down this morning too. So I decided to row 2k pieces and do the burpee pull-ups at home. Meanwhile the rain had stopped and I added a 6k run to go the full distance.</p>

<p>I have to admit, this wasn't so bad at all. I actually quite enjoyed the run and was able to go faster towards the end. Blood blisters on my fingers from the burpee pull-ups will remind of this WOD the next couple of days.</p>

<p>Nick,</p>

<p>Welcome to crossfit. I would recommend first learning perfect technique on all lifts if you have not already. If your following th main site know when to scale. Most important is nutrition. You will never outrain bad nutrition. There r a lot of good resources on this site regarding proper nutrition for crossfit. <br />

<p>For those who come out of this having difficulty moving, or concern that you will be in that condition tomorrow and days to follow, I highly recommend you head over to CrossFit Endurance and check out the "strength and conditioning recovery wod."  Concept is you do it 10 minutes after this workout and do it again everyday that follows until you feel relatively normal.  Good luck all and thanks to B-Mac for the S&CR program design element.</p>

<p>Bingo,</p>

<p>Thanks for all your musings - they are a delight to read and ponder about and you give words to some feelings and thoughts that I have a hard time expressing. I especially like the one where you talk about the worth of a friend and how you are the one getting the most out of a dinner or something even though you pay for it. <br />
My unit encourages us MIDN to think about the meaning of these days and I have been wondering what a good way to honor Veteran's Day would be. Many ideas come to mind but in the end I settled on this. Give friends a call/email who are in the military and express thanks. Go for a run with mom and appreciate having family and friends and the happiness and blessings I have in my life due to these extraordinary men and women. Thank a stranger. Hit a CF hero workout hard tomorrow. <br />
Thanks for also being a motivator/role model in CF  and in life. Looking forward to entering into the medical field after college. Enjoy the day.<br />

<p>i wasn't tough enough for the whole thing but did 5 miles and 100 burpee pullups in 57:14. I did it with my daugher (4 1/2 weeks postpartum) and my son-in-law. I thought about "clovis" but also thought about my son serving in afghanistan.</p>

<p>Hey guys, great WOD today... I've been doing CrossFit for two months, and I have to admit, this was the toughest WOD yet. I'm happy this came up today, because it helped me understand that the tough is still there. I had to scale down to 5K run and 100 burpee pull-ups. I did vomit today, but most importantly, I'm so happy that tomorrow is rest day.... Thank you all from CrossFit for your posts- you guys are all my motivation. Today is rememberence day in Canada, and today's WOD Was a tribute to all the soldiers who served. </p>

<p>I decided to break this up to 1 mile 15 burpee pull ups for 10 rounds. The best route I could configure where I would end at the pull up bar was a little longer than a mile so in the end according to my running app I did 12.47 miles and 150 burpee pull ups in 1:58:08. My knee is killing me today but this was a small sacrifice to make in comparison to what our veterans have and continue to sacrifice.  </p>
