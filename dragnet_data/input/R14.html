		<p>I started wearing foam earplugs at night when we were trying to get Dylan to sleep through the night. They didn&#8217;t <em>block</em> the noise, not by a long shot, but they gave me a slight sense of removal from the situation that helped me grit my teeth and bear a few extra minutes of crying (before I inevitably got up and dealt with him because OMFG ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THIS SHITUATION) (please enjoy my upcoming sleep training/potty training/bedwetting/disciplinary books: <em>Consistency Is the Key To Success!</em>).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t sleep without them, now. There&#8217;s something about the ritual I go through every night &#8212; folding over a page in my book and stacking it on the nightstand, turning off the light, and scrunching up the earplugs before settling them in my ears &#8212; that&#8217;s like putting a cover on a birdcage. I like the muffled, fuzzy way I hear things, as though I&#8217;m buried deep in a soft pillow, or already half-asleep and dreaming. Our house isn&#8217;t loud, exactly, but it&#8217;s set up just like our old home: all three bedrooms are clustered together at the end of a wood hallway. Every snort and snuffle is magnified, and the instant I hear a kid shifting around in bed, I&#8217;m sent right back to those no-sleep nights of Dylan&#8217;s, instantly bathed in a full-body anxiety, waiting for someone to erupt into wakefulness with a blurry, rising cry: <em>eh-heh, eh-heh, eh-heh, EHHHHHHHHHHH.</em></p>
<p>Not that anyone wakes up like that these days, but I guess I haven&#8217;t quite shaken the memories. This is the same reason I jump like a startled forest animal when someone coughs, because YOU&#8217;RE NOT GOING TO BARF ARE YOU????</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve also found that earplugs an essential item for tent camping, because they make all the difference between lying there wide-eyed and straining to hear the hook-handed psycho killer/slobbering grizzly that&#8217;s surely lurking just outside the flap, and actually, you know, sleeping. Too bad they don&#8217;t eliminate that 3 AM appointment with stumbling out in the pitch-dark and nervously peeing on your own foot, but I guess you can&#8217;t have everything.</p>
<p>I forgot them a while back when we were visiting JB&#8217;s parents&#8217; house, and it was awful. AWFUL. I honestly felt like my nerves were lit up like a Christmas tree. I could hear people <em>breathing</em>. Molecules were banging around and the fibers of the sheets were making noise and ugh. The worst. Clearly they&#8217;ve become a habit, and I guess that&#8217;s not great &#8230; but I&#8217;ve had worse addictions, is all I can say.</p>
<p>This is the part where it probably seems like I&#8217;m going to wrap things up by saying this thrilling post was sponsored by Sealy Posturepedic Mattresses or something, but really, I&#8217;m just curious: do you have any sleep requirements? Something you absolutely must have &#8212; a pillow, a sound machine, a fistful of Unisom &#8212; in order to fall asleep?</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m with you. I had to sleep without earplugs the other night (because the last pair in the box had been used waaay too many times &#8211; they no longer sprang back after I squooshed them)and it was the loudest, longest night of my life. I had to go downstairs to the sofa and I could still hear my husband snoring, the clock ticking and chiming every gd half hour, the traffic, the dog shifting and sighing. I am addicted as well, and I will never run out of them again. NEVAH!</p>

			<p>So just to be clear, you can just LEAVE your earplugs sitting adorably on your nightstand like that, and the cat doesn&#8217;t hijack them without 30 minutes and eats or knocks them irretrievably under something? Because I can&#8217;t ever leave earplugs out. Just sitting there. Not even in a bowl. Huh?</p>
<p>Erm&#8230; I really hate to sleep in pants. Undies only, please. Also my feet must be covered by the blankets, and either a ceiling pan or stand fan on. But I generally manage to fall asleep in the rare cases where I can&#8217;t have it my way (but camping trips = worst sleep EVAR).</p>

			<p>So glad I&#8217;m not alone in my earplug addiction! I swear that since having kids every sound is magnified, of course only while I&#8217;m trying to sleep. Including my husband&#8217;s snoring. I also became addicted to my body pillow during pregnancy (7 years ago) and an extra pillow over my head to block out even more noise, and any light that creeps through the blackout curtains. Whenever I&#8217;m sleeping away from home it&#8217;s so embarrassing to have an extra suitcase just for my pillows. But not embarrassing enough to wean myself off of them.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t judge anyone ( but stuffed humpty dumpty &#8211; hee) because my husband and I both must have a fan to sleep. It&#8217;s really a pain because we are travel writer/photographer so have to pack our fan. No small carryon only for us because that sucker holds the fan. If anyone else needs a small, loud travel fan, we found the Vornado from Target is perfect after much experimentation and telling sales people that we wanted a loud fan, not a quiet fan. Thank God we are married because nobody else would have us. If the power goes out and the fan turns off, we both snap awake instantly.</p>

			<p>Interestingly,.I can do either earplugs or white noise, preferably a fan.  I have 6&#8243; fan that travels with me for this purpose.  I was forced to try earplugs at burning man (lack of electricity and lots of noise) and was surprised at my success.  I still haven&#8217;t completely solved the foreign travel conundrum &#8211; in Germany I fried the fan inside of 2 minutes (220v outlet fail), followed by forgetting my ipod at my cousin&#8217;s apt; in Morocco I didn&#8217;t even try for a fan, but the earplugs did me fine for every night after the first, when the sunrise call to prayer jolted me wide awake at 5 a.m.  The other reason for the fan is that I don&#8217;t like the sealed-in-tupperware feeling without moving air, whether it be an open window or a fan or whatever.  That will keep me as awake as noise or utter silence.</p>

			<p>I only use earplugs in the summer if the air conditioner HAS TO be on at night. Sometimes my hub and I have a standoff on that issue. If it was on at night when i went to bed, the rule before the earplugs was &#8211; if I wake up in the middle of the night, it goes off.

My boyfriend and I also sleep with our window AC unit on all year. Even when the heat is on, we still have our AC set to 61 degrees to keep the fan running all night for the white noise. I swear, I am so lucky he&#8217;s a silent sleeper, or I would banish him to the guest room.

			<p>Must have my ears covered. Can not sleep if I feel air breezing over my ears. This is unfortunate because my husband can&#8217;t sleep unless a fan is on. Solved by wearing hoodie to bed (v. sexy btw). Also must go to sleep on my side and have blanket tucked between my knees because I&#8217;m getting old and the joints hurt stacked on each other. Phew!

			<p>Oh, this was fun &#8212; I&#8217;m feeling pretty &#8216;normal&#8217; now about my little orange foam-y earplugs.  I may have to force my &#8220;Earplugs?  Why on earth do you wear EARPLUGS?&#8221; friends to read these entries! :) I started wearing them after many many many nights of ruined sleep and escalating levels of resentment because of my husband&#8217;s snoring. But a couple of years ago, he lost some weight and the snoring gene, too! :)  I&#8217;m now able to sleep without the earplugs most of the time but still sometimes use one in the &#8220;outward facing ear&#8221; just as a . . . .security blanket, I guess. (Have to fall asleep on my stomach with my head on my right arm.) And an extra packet or two ALWAYS stay in my travel make-up bag so I don&#8217;t have to worry about forgetting to pack them &#8212; just in case there is snoring or weird noises in strange hotel rooms!</p>

			<p>HOW do you sleep in ear plugs?!?! Because I love that fuzzed-out sound/feeling, but I cannot abide the pressure in my ear canals. The weird latex ones that&#8230;I guess it kind of lays OVER your ear hole? That was even worse. Maybe it&#8217;s because I sleep on my side?</p>
<p>I need a sound machine, now that the apt complex has turned off the swamp coolers and I can&#8217;t sleep in the silence with my love snoring/shifting/breathing SO LOUDLY GAWD. I actually shushed him last night, much to our mutual morning amusement.</p>

			<p>I worked 12-hour night shift (7pm to 7am) for years, thus necessitating frequent daytime sleeping.  i lived in NYC at the time, so i had a lot of street noise to deal with.  i tried plugging my ears, but because i am apparently a houdini when i sleep, they always came out.  i tried white noise (fans, tv/radio to static, iphone apps) all to no avail because the street noise was still too loud.  i ended up having the best luck sleeping with the tv on (i would usually end up falling asleep to the today show!  ha!) and have been unable to sleep without the tv on since.  there were a few trips where i slept in a room with no tv&#8230;thank god for my iphone!  not the best thing, but also not the worst.  im just happy to have been able to not have to need meds&#8230;  and now that i work a normal 9-5 type job, i sleep solid&#8230;.with the tv on!</p>

			<p>Yeah, I suck at sleeping.  1-2 glasses of red wine… Body positioned on my left side… Vornado fan set to high and blowing directly up my nose… dense pillow between my knees, feather pillow under my head and light foam pillow on top of my head &#8211; eyes covered by the pillow and nose and mouth exposed to the wind tunnel that is my room.  The temp should be below 70 (preferably 65) and the blankets should be down.  All that pomp and circumstance and I still wake-up 5 times a night for no apparent reason.  Add 1 husband with severe sleep apnea and a 4 year old with asthma and it’s a wonder I sleep at all.  I’ve decided that sharing a bed is highly overrated.</p>

			<p>Fantastic mental pictures going on here! My favorite is @Kim with the codependent cat rituals &#8211; I&#8217;d like to hear from the cat, too.</p>
<p>I can sleep anywhere with all kinds of noise. Maybe this is because I fall asleep within minutes of being still and I love sleep, but I have to coach myself through the torturous process of getting ready for bed each night. It&#8217;s just five steps (remove contacts, floss, brush teeth, wash face, pee), but if I don&#8217;t do them all, I will end up dreaming about flossing all night. I break it down to percentage points and once I get to 60% I am flooded with relief that it is highly likely I will unlock pillow victory once again.</p>

			<p>Wow!  75 comments and counting.  I guess I am not alone!  </p>
<p>I, too, need earplugs to sleep.  (A few months ago, I bought several packages of the rubber kind, with a post attached, from the internet).  I also need a sleep mask.  I have extras of both, and I keep them in my travel toiletries bag at ALL times, so I am never without.  You should do the same!</p>
<p>I also, most of the time, must listen to an iPod (audiobook, the same one over and over) while I am trying to fall asleep. (I switch out the iPod for the earplugs during the inevitable first pee break of the night).  I also need a pillow between my legs.  And a smaller pillow below the small of my back.  And, of course, a nice high layer (which usually means 2) of pillow for under my head.</p>
<p>My dirty sleep secrets are now exposed.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m a really light sleeper &amp; my husband snores like a freight train. I seriously worried when we were dating that I might never get a decent night sleep again when we were first together. I started wearing earplugs &amp; it helps, for sure. Like you, I can&#8217;t sleep without them now- even when he&#8217;s out of town or when I travel for work. Why is it that the person in the relationship who snores is also the one who sleeps like the dead? A tree could fall next to my husband when he&#8217;s sleeping &amp; he wouldn&#8217;t stir, whereas me, I can hear a spider walking a block away and not only do I wake up, but then I can&#8217;t go back to sleep for hours. Not fair, I tell ya!</p>

<p>But I must listen to Old Time Radio as I fall asleep. Dragnet, Gunsmoke&#8230; can&#8217;t sleeep without it, have been listening for 15 years. It&#8217;s comforting. I listen to one 30 minute story, get up and pee one last time, and fall asleep. If I don&#8217;t pee, then i just lay awake knowing that I will soon have to pee.</p>

			<p>I have to have my feet covered, even if it is freaking 100 degrees inside (which happens), I have to have them covered.  I also like to sleep with either just one sock on or both socks only partially on (up to my arch).  And I can&#8217;t just go to bed with them like that, I go to bed with both socks fully on then decide which way I&#8217;m going to do it and use just my feet (under the covers) to fix the socks the right way.  I also have a pre-bed routine which includes setting the security system before going upstairs, then getting everyone ready for bed, then going back downstairs just to make sure I really did set the alarm, then I can go to sleep.</p>

I must have a loud fan on. It just drowns everything out. I cannot sleep without it &#8212; even in the middle of winter. If i dont have it, I hear every god damned little noise, breath, grunt &#8212; and it makes me want to rip off faces.<br />
Also, no pants. Hate pants. Only panties and a tank, please.</p>

			<p>Winter I must be cocooned in my blanket like a burrito, with the blanket tucked under my feet. Summer I must have only the sheet, and only between my legs. I don&#8217;t know why. I position myself on my left side, almost on my stomach, arms under the wadded up feather pillow, fall almost asleep, startle awake, then roll over to exact same position on right side and fall asleep for the night. Why don&#8217;t I just start out on my right side, you ask? Because when I do, I startle awake, roll over to left, startle awake and back to right. Which is when I sleep all night. WTF, Brain? Also, here&#8217;s my guilty admission. As a young child I worried about the vampire under my bed getting me in my sleep. My child brain reasoned that he could only get me if one of my body parts was hanging over the edge of the bed &#8211; finger, knee, foot, whatever. So I couldn&#8217;t fall asleep unless every part of my body was completely on the mattress and not in danger of hanging over any edge. Now I am 48  years old, 5&#8242;-10&#8243; and I STILL cannot sleep if any body part is near or (gasp!) actually hanging over the edge. Shudder.</p>

			<p>I have a bizarre one. I have to sleep with a pillow over my head &#8211; not covering my entire head, just the top down to my nose. That started when I was a teenager, and the sun would come in and wake me up at dawn every day in the summer. I&#8217;d put the pillow over my head to block it out so I could go back to sleep, and it became a habit. Now I absolutely can&#8217;t get to sleep without it!</p>

I&#8217;m also worried if I go to ear plugs..I won&#8217;t hear my children in the next room if they need me or start to hurl. I LOVE these stories, LOVE them!</p>

			<p>I started wearing earplugs at night for the exact same reason!! I have always slept with a fan, but because my daughter and I slept in the same room, the white noise was not enough &#8212; I needed SOUND BLOCKING. I eventually broke myself of this habit, because the insides of my ears were raw, but it was difficult. The fan helps. I don&#8217;t use earplugs at home anymore, but I keep a box (not just a pair, a box) of them in my suitcase so I am never without them while traveling, or I would never sleep.</p>

			<p>Yes. I have to have some kind of white noise thing going &#8211; the fan (at home) or this wonderful device I bought for traveling because you can store a rotating fan in the overhead bins when flying. :) I use earplugs at night for awhile but they hurt and once my husband turns off his noisy stupid book light, I can sleep. They don&#8217;t block the snoring anyway so no need to keep them in. I also have to have complete darkness. No seeping light from around the shades, no blinking electronic lights. This is hard to do and it killed me when I realized I&#8217;d left my sleep mask (which was wonderful) at the beach house last summer. Need to buy a new one.</p>

			<p>Between having kids and my husband starting to snore a few years ago, I seem to have developed a number of sleep rituals/habits that I find it difficult to sleep without.  I used to need a sleep mask and earplugs.  Then it was sleep mask and sound soother or fan on.  Finally, I managed to combine them into a fuzzy headband with built in speakers to play soothing wind sounds that also covers my eyes.  Sometimes I feel like the princess and the pea with this stuff, but without it, I don&#8217;t sleep because everyone else is making so damned much noise.  Why is it that men are so noisy and yet sleep through everything?  Unfair.</p>

<p>White noise machine &#8211; the big heavy duty one, mind you, no wussy apps here. I&#8217;ve got tinnitus and without the white noise I&#8217;d go completely batshit in two days. Also the lip balm, and I now have to sleep with a small blanket over the covers draped over my thighs or those muscles cramp in the &#8220;cold&#8221; under the quilt and sheet by morning. I also loathe drafts on my neck and our bed is under the window so I sleep with a pillow between the top of my head and the headboard.<br />
My husband snores like crazy and some nights I don&#8217;t even notice it and others I want to commit murder. Ear plugs don&#8217;t work so must think of other ways to fix this problem.</p>
<p>My kid is also a hair-trigger barfer and like you every time he coughs total panic sets in. He&#8217;s had allergies/sinus problems the last three weeks&#8230;it&#8217;s been very stressful!</p>

			<p>Huh, this is fascinating. For me, I hate having anything on. Always naked. If for some reason I have to wear something, it&#8217;s panties and t-shirt. Anything else might bunch up or pull or just annoy me. Even if it&#8217;s very hot, I have to be covered up to sleep. A sheet works. White noise? NO. NO. A thousand times, NO. We&#8217;ve tried that, and I lay awake wondering if the noise of the fan or the dryer or whatever is drowning out the sounds of the zombies clawing through the door, or my daughter calling for me. I haven&#8217;t tried earplugs, because I imagine the muffling effect would cause the same reaction.<br />
When I&#8217;m done reading and ready to sleep, I take three or four deep ten count inhales and exhales, tell myself to relax all my muscles, then I mentally repeat to myself &#8220;I will sleep deeply and well. I will relax into a deep, restful sleep&#8230;&#8221; over and over again until I&#8217;m out. It works for the most part. I&#8217;m still exhausted when morning comes all too soon, but I don&#8217;t have that feeling of laying there frustrated because I can&#8217;t sleep. As soon as I start feeling panicky or annoyed that sleep is not coming, I cut off those thoughts and switch to the mantra. If nothing else, it forces my  heart rate to slow and my breathing to ease.</p>

			<p>Up until I was 18 or so, I HAD to pray before I went to sleep or else I would just stay awake forever. PRAYING WAS A MUST. And then I went to college and became a godless heathen, and now I can sleep anywhere, anytime, on a train, on the street, whatevs. I&#8217;m like a hobo!</p>
<p>Assuming I&#8217;m in my bed like a normal person, I need some kind of blanket covering me. Ideally I&#8217;d like the room to be as cold as possible so I can curl up beneath many blankets. Currently I live in an apartment where the building controls our heat/AC, so right now the heat is always blasting even though it&#8217;s been upwards of 70 degrees outside for the past few weeks. My room is a consistent 85 degrees, so I&#8217;ve spent a LOT of nighttime hours wrestling with a tower fan and blankets and wahhhh, lame. Last night I finally just pulled my shirt off and slept with a sheet over me, and it was the perfect magic combo!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s like a 75% chance I shirtlessly wandered into the bathroom in our hallway, where my roommate&#8217;s boyfriend might&#8217;ve seen me, but whatever, I&#8217;ve got good boobs.</p>

			<p>Noise and darkness. We have blackout blinds but the streetlight still bleeds through around the edges, so I really have to put up those curtains that have been sitting around for three years. (I&#8217;m a procrastinatrix and I am proud.) </p>
<p>I use an air purifier, and a white noise machine. Mom bought us a fancy-schmancy Sharper Image multi-setting noise machine, but I have to use it in conjunction with something. Because I CAN HERE WHERE THE SOUND FILES BEGIN AND END, and will be up all night listening for JUST where they begin to repeat.</p>

			<p>I used to be a Benadryl junkie, till I got pregnant. Now that we have the baby I have developed this super weird (to me) habit of sleeping with a pillow over my face. It drowns out the baby-anxiety I constantly feel and muffles the house noises but still allows me to hear her if she cries. The downside besides possible asphyxiation is that I wake up with a Sally from Peanuts-style pile of fuzz in the front of my head every morning from my bangs rubbing against the pillow.</p>

			<p>The tiny melatonin pill I take before bed helps me turn off my brain.  And I have a pretty hard time falling asleep if I don&#8217;t get to read for a few minutes first.  But the strangest requirement is Mooey &#8211; a stuffed cow I got as a gift when I was pregnant with my daughter, that I put under my chin every night before sleeping.

			<p>I&#8217;ve been wearing ear plugs lately and I think I&#8217;ll be dependent on them pretty soon. My baby actually sleeps pretty well most nights, sleeping 5-6 hrs and then waking twice before morning. But, I was waking up multiple times a night. When my husband came to bed, with his snoring, the cat coming in and out, cars driving down our street&#8230;Earplugs help a lot, and listening to my own breathing helps me fall asleep, too.</p>

			<p>It sounds so basic, but: a clean spot. I&#8217;ve traveled a fair bit for work, doing some really varied stuff, and I have learned to sleep under stages, below sound boards, on top of road boxes (those big wheeled cases you&#8217;ll see if you ever watch a concert load in or out), in tiny tour bus bunks, in ancient drafty travel trailers, and on convention center floors. As long as what is touching my skin is clean and free of dust (a tall order when your trailer has been in a dust storm for 2 weeks), I&#8217;m happy and comfortable.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I went into reading this comments feeling like a pretty low-maintenance sleeper, and I came away feeling like the easiest sleeper on the planet, and incredibly grateful for it!  We live between a fire station and a hospital and on a busy bus route, but have become so inured to the noise that we are legitimately surprised when people stay with us and bring it up.  I am surprised though that I can still sleep in very quite settings.  I have joked that God gives everyone a special gift and mine is sleep. My only quirk is that I MUST empty my bladder as the absolute last thing before bed- if I&#8217;m lying in bed and start thinking about it, I HAVE to get up and pee.</p>
<p>I love how so many quirky sleepers have discovered that they are not alone through this thread, but I would also love to hear from the comically good sleepers out there- what&#8217;s the craziest place you&#8217;ve fallen/stayed asleep?  I can&#8217;t decide between a Tool concert and a large-scale sporting event.</p>

			<p>What an interesting topic! I have to fall alseep with the tv on. Before I set the timmer for 30 minutes I flip through the channels until I find a channel that doesn&#8217;t have extra loud commercials (or even better, no commercials). The program should be interesting enough to hold my attention and distract the voices in my head, but not so interesting that I want to stay awake to watch it. Once the tv goes off there should be no light and no noise, but I can&#8217;t sleep with earplugs or an eye mask. </p>
<p>I also have a certain arrangement of pillows to support various body parts and/or snuggle with, and I don&#8217;t use sheets (just a light quilt under me and either a light quilt or comforter on top depending on the season)</p>
<p>MUST sleep nude, I cannot stand to have clothes on in bed! </p>

<p>I fall asleep *so* much more easily if I have been in the company of Indian friends or have been watching BBC earlier in the day.

			<p>I have been considering getting earplugs so I can sleep through anyone else in the house getting up to pee in the middle of the night. I was worried I wouldn&#8217;t hear emergency calls for me but now I&#8217;m sold on just muting the sounds. Love the camp noise descriptions! I think I am also going to invest in a sleep mask but those don&#8217;t block out the images leftover from AHS and TWD, do they? I don&#8217;t have any must-haves to go to sleep but then again I am constantly sleep-deprived. I have made the Little Ones reliant on their lullaby music (2 hrs) for sleep and naps, so now they can&#8217;t sleep if the volume is not just right and they have trained themselves to wake up when the music is off or at a certain song. Time to add more songs!</p>
<p>I need to set up a household whitenoise machine so we can all sleep more soundly(and not hear the hook-handed psycho killer/slobbering grizzly or zombies outside our windows).</p>

			<p>Oh My God YES</p>
<p>Everyone makes fun of me getting ready to sleep.  I don&#8217;t even know how it started but I know it came in stages.  Sometime when I was a kid I realized my sister in law slept with a fan in her face and I tried it and liked it and some 20 years later I now MUST have a fan in my face.  I even take them with me on trips.  I also have a sound machine that I started using about two years ago, on what I can only describ as the roaring setting.  It lulls me to sleep.  Sooo soothing.</p>
<p>But, by far the one I take the most rap for is, I have to have an eye mask.  </p>
<p>It all started when we moved in here about 3 years ago and the fire detector has a green flashy light that flashes all friggen night long.  I don&#8217;t really care about most constant lights, like the time on the clock or what not, yes I know it changes but it doesn&#8217;t flash.  This one flashy light drove me insane.  My first thought was to cover the light up, but we have really tall celings and no ladder and so yeah.  As a joke a friend got me an eye mask that said something about a princess and I tried it and it worked.  Since I&#8217;ve bought several others settling on one favorite.  </p>
<p>Recently on a trip I left mine at home and had to go purchase one at 1am because I couldn&#8217;t fall asleep, everything was so bright and my eyes needed their comfy pillow!!!  wow</p>
<p>Just call me princess Sara</p>

			<p>Also earplugs, I love the 3M orange ones and buy them in bulk. Sleeping without them is virtually imposible, I don&#8217;t understand how people can sleep with all the noise, even though technically, there is hardly any noise at all. Lip balm is also important to me to fall asleep and putting in the ear plugs and putting on the lip balm are signals to my brain that it&#8217;s bed time, I&#8217;m asleep less than a minute later.</p>

<p>Alas, no more. Now, take an over-the-counter sleeping pill, read for a while, then turn on the TV to something that’s only mildly interesting but not annoying (the Discovery channel is GREAT and the History channel used to be before they went all apocalypse and ancient aliens all the time) at a low volume that I have to strain to understand, a noise machine set to white noise, and a face mask. And my feet have to stick out from under the covers because they get hot. And lately I’ve added a pillow over my head to block out any other noise and light. I rarely fall asleep in any time less than an hour. Oh, and I haven’t slept in the same room as my husband in months because he snores.</p>

			<p>I keep thinking of more things. The door must be shut so that the cats can’t come in. About this time of year, the air gets so dry that I have to have the humidifier on. Sometimes, I still get a dry cough and have to have a cough drop, which can last for half a night if you tuck it just right (I’m sure that’s terrible for my teeth, plus I’ll probably choke on it some night). If there’s nothing on TV that fits into the mildly interesting category, I put on a mildly interesting podcast. I haven’t yet found earphones that are comfortable enough to sleep in (and again, I’ll probably strangle myself on the cord some night). And my pants must be adjusted just right on my stomach or hip so that I can’t feel it when I’m lying on my side. My phone charger has an annoying blue light, so I have to block it with a coin.</p>

			<p>I have a bedtime habit that also comes in the form of two pink things (yikes, that sounds pervy). Two Benadryl tablets. They put me out so quickly and into such a deep sleep, I&#8217;m hooked.

I started doing this back in my single days when I lived next to a freeway and a car dealership &#8211; wanted to drown out the L.A. traffic but still be able to hear the ax-wielding maniac entering my apartment.<br />
Now I use it to drown out my husband&#8217;s snores without completely deafening me to any cries of peril from my 4 year old in the night (we *just* got through a round of croup which ended in a dash to the ER because he literally couldn&#8217;t breathe, so I&#8217;m still a little shell-shocked)</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307341577/ref=nosim/?tag=allsund-20"><strong>Dark Places, by Gillian Flynn</strong></a> 
<small>Gone Girl and Sharp Objects are also great, but I think I liked this one the best. They're all twisted, more than a little unpleasant, and barrel along like a freight train. </small>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GP5HJI/ref=nosim/?tag=allsund-20"><strong>BSN Syntha-6 protein powder</strong></a> 
<small>I use this stuff (the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor) in smoothies all the time, it's remarkably tasty and non-supplementy. One scoop is 22 grams of protein.</small>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0082D9SKK/ref=nosim/?tag=allsund-20"><strong>Revlon Just Bitten Kissable Balm</strong></a> 
<small>I just bought this on a whim and it's fantastic—goes on soft and smooth, gives nice even color. It's basically a very cool balm/lipliner/lipstick hybrid.</small>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1401213170/ref=nosim/?tag=allsund-20"><strong>SCALPED, by Jason Aaron & R.M. Guéra</strong></a> 
<small>Best graphic novel series I've read in years. Brutal, dark, compelling, and almost surely the only comic containing the phrase "<em>Hoka hey, motherfuckers!</em>"</small>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004SGS3B0/ref=nosim/?tag=allsund-20"><strong>Beyblade Metal Masters Battle Set</strong></a> 
<small>Ugh, BEYBLADES, right? What can I say, the kids love these things. This seems like it's been a good purchase for a kid just starting to get into them (and it's perfect for battling with a sibling or reluctant parent).</small>
