HTC and Verizon hooking up Nov. 13 in NYC

Hmmmmm. HTC and Verizon are having a little get-together on Nov. 13 in New York City.

The invite doesn't exactly lend itself to interpretation, just "come experience our latest collaboration." Chances are pretty good we'll see the Droid DNA, the 5-inch smartphone we brought you the first pictures of a few weeks ago under its Droid DLX codename. The phone has since all but been confirmed through a couple of leaked renders as well.

Set your alarms, boys and girls, cause we'll be there.

Do we know for sure this is Android related as opposed to 8X?

Well I guess they could talk about the HTC 8X here as well but since they sent the invite to an Android site I think we are assuming it is for the Droid DNA. :-)

Yeah, true. But I know WPCentral has gotten invitations to and attended events which turned out not to have any WP news. Dunno if the reverse has ever happened though with AC.

That hint of a big red droid eye in the lower right-hand corner scream Android.

I'm not seeing the Droid eye as much as something on the horizon.

It is a special announcement that Ice Cream Sandwich is coming to the Incredible 2.

This is the dealbreaker for me. If HTC comes through and delivers ICS for the TB before they announce the DNA, I may have renewed faith that they'll actually update devices. No ICS for the TB = no $$ from me going to HTC ever again. Clock is ticking, HTC......

Is this better than the Note 2?? I guess I have to add another choice to my list of phones to buy. This is getting crazy. First world pains...

Once you go Nexus though...every other Android phone just seems irrelevant. The only exception would be those which don't have physical/capacitive nav buttons and which have been unlocked/rooted with support for a CM/AOKP type ROM.

Based on what we know about the Butterfly, I would say Note 2.

Things to look out for with this HTC release:

1. Is the battery gimped? Currently, it is. Hopefully boosted for U.S. release.
2. Is it removable?
3. Does it have an SD card slot? (Forgivable if ample memory included.)

What Note 2 has that HTC DNA doesn't is a stylus. What HTC DNA has that Note 2 doesn't have is 1080p. The DNA is also smaller, which can be a pro and con. The pro is that it's easier to handle. The con is it's a smaller screen, which may not be an issue when we are talking screens this size.

osubeavs728 says:

Everything you listed is subjective. A non remove-able battery and no SD card slot may be a deal breaker for some, but for others it's not an issue at all, or may even be favorable. Also, unless there have been actual tests with the battery no one knows how long it will last. Just because it says 2500 doesn't mean it won't last two days with the technology they've put into the phone. Numbers mean nothing until real world tests and applications happen. Just my two cents

nickacs says:

I agree 100%. Non-removable battery and no SD card is 100% subjective, period. Just look at all the cry babies in the Nexus 4 forum that complain constantly about this. If YOU don't like it, then YOU don't buy the phone and move on. STFU, I'm siiiiiick of it!

I'm sure both the DNA and the 8X will be announced. This will show how HTC and Verizon are working together.

turdbogls says:

What are they thinking announcing a phone on Nexus launch day? either do it a few days before or do it after...not on the biggest launch day for android enthusiests.

but what do i know.

"announcing the Droid DNA with android 4.1"

"murmer murmer, didn't they just announce android 4.2? murmer murmer"

The vast majority of Android users don't know one version from another. No point in moving their launch date to account for a very small subset who most likely wouldn't be interested in this device anyway. (Nexus fans)

Too bad HTC is sticking with the 1 carrier partnership. Way to shoot yourself in the foot. If HTC wants any chance of not going bankrupt, they need to bring products like this, unchanged, to every single carrier possible. I'm sticking with Samsung because of this.

Agreed HTC doesn't know the winning formula for success, that's why they continue to post losses each quarter. They need a brand like Samsung and Apple. The One series was the answer until they bowed down to the carriers and made it different (except ATT). I mean we know the iPhone and Samsung has the Galaxy line, what does HTC have is it the One X no maybe its the EVO, or wait maybe its the Droid Inc. See no one knows until HTC stops shooting themselves in the foot they will die a slow and painful death. And like you my fellow Android fan I will be sticking with Sammy from here on out.
