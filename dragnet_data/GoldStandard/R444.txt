It’s that time of year again. Families are getting together. Presents are being exchanged (well, not quite yet, but it’s just around the corner), and geeks are buying cell phones. This year has been the craziest one yet, and there’s a vast variety of phones – both rumored and currently available – that will be vying for your hard earned dollars.

On the Android front, there’s more than a few high-end options to choose from. We’ve got the current monster phone, the Galaxy Note II, currently leading the way in terms of sheer specs and speed. Next is Google’s pure (and budget conscious) Nexus 4, a long rumored device produced by LG. HTC has a few phones in the pipeline, and we may be hearing about the long rumored DROID DNA in the not too distant future. And last but not least, Motorola has the DROID RAZR HD as it’s current flagship.

We understand that not everyone is going for an Android phone this time around, and we respect that. Right now is a good time to experiment, with Windows Phone 8 finally bringing a third contender to the market. The two flagships are Nokia’s Lumia 920 and HTC’s Windows Phone 8X. Finally, for those looking to jump all the way across the pond, Apple’s latest iPhone finally has a larger screen and LTE.

So, what will it be? The polls are waiting for you just below, and the leader of our country isn’t at stake this time around. If we missed something, be sure to let us know what it is in the comments below!
