Not to be outdone with Samsung’s latest $249 Chromebook, Acer is also introducing its second-generation Chromebook that’s worth $199. We previously reported that Acer is prepping up a second-generation Chromebook and is already poised for a mid-October release. Well, it looks like Acer has just timed the launch perfectly, considering how busy October was. The new Acer C7 Chromebook promises to deliver a hassle-free computing experience with speed, built-in security, and the simplicity of automatic updates.

It sports an 11.6-inch display with a 1366 x 768 resolution and it comes with a full-size keyboard, fully clickable trackpad, and a battery that offers around 3.5 hours of battery life. Inside the new Acer Chromebook is an Intel Core processor, an HD camera, USB 2.0, a 320GB hard drive, and a whopping 100GB of free storage on Google Drive. Expect this Chromebook to hit stores tomorrow, November 13 at the price of $199. Get this on Google Play and Best Buy.

“Creating a better, simpler computer and making it available for everyone is at the core of the Chromebook vision. It’s exciting to see people using Chromebooks as the perfect additional computer in the home, and we continue to work with our partners to make them easy-to-use and more affordable,” said Sundar Pichai, Senior Vice-President for Chrome and Apps at Google. “Today, we’re delighted that our partner Acer is introducing a new addition to the Chromebook family: the new Acer C7 Chromebook.”
