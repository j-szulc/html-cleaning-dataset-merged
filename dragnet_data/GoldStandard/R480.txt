HTC and Verizon event set for November 13, DROID DNA on the Horizon

In just a few more days the folks from HTC and Verizon will be unveiling their next big smartphone. We say big because most likely come November 13th in NYC at 11 AM EST they’ll be announcing and showing the world their new HTC DROID DNA. The 5-inch 1080p quad-core smartphone we’ve been dying to hear more about. More details after the break. 

While we can’t be exactly certain what to expect from the press event come next Tuesday, multiple leaks lately have us all pointing at the HTC “dlx” — also called the DROID Incredible X — but latest leaks and even internal documents have all surfaced calling this the HTC DROID DNA. Verizon passed on the HTC ONE series that everyone else partook in, and we have a feeling this was why.

For those not keeping track the HTC DROID DNA is expected to be a 5-inch 1920x1080p full HD smartphone. Packing 440 PPI inside that crisp and vibrant SLCD 3 display. Along with that impressive sounding display you’ll get Qualcomm’s 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, rumored 16GB of storage, 8 or 12 megapixel camera and a decent 2,500 mAh battery. 

The image above is the latest leaked image, and we’re hearing it’ll launch early December with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and Sense UI 4.1 on board. We don’t expect Android 4.2 this early in the game, but surely that will come soon. Leaks have stated December 6th as of late, but with an announcement coming next week we could see a late November launch. Just in time for all those holiday and Black Friday shoppers. We’ll be there live so stay tuned right here for full details, pictures, and hands-on video.
