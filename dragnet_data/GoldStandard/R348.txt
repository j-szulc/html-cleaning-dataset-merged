Resveratrol Ineffective in Normal-Weight Women
By NICHOLAS BAKALAR

Resveratrol, the red wine component shown to be helpful in improving metabolic function in obese or diabetic people, has no discernible effect on healthy women who are not obese, a new experiment has found.

In a small 12-week randomized, double-blinded trial, researchers gave 29 normal weight postmenopausal women either 75 milligrams a day of resveratrol or a placebo, testing their metabolic function at the start and end of the study.

Blood concentrations of resveratrol increased in the group given the supplements, but the scientists found no difference between them and those given the placebo in body composition, resting metabolic rate or glucose tolerance (a test for insulin resistance and diabetes).

The study, to be published in this week’s issue of the journal Cell Metabolism, found that blood pressure, heart rate, C-reactive protein levels (a measure of inflammation), LDL, HDL and total cholesterol were unaffected by resveratrol. In other words, resveratrol blood concentrations were associated with no quantifiable changes, beneficial or otherwise, in any measure of metabolic function.

Does this mean that resveratrol offers no benefits? Not necessarily, said the senior author, Dr. Samuel Klein, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. “We only show that metabolically healthy people get no benefits to begin with,” he said. “We have no way of knowing whether it will prevent future metabolic complications.”
