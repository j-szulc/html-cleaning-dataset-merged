Its 1.30AM in Singapore right now and I need to get up in a few hours to be on stage at Asia's biggest Anime Event - the Anime Festival Asia.

None of our team have slept to bring you the biggest Mirai-chan booth ever - this time we will be serving a load of Mirai-chan goodies - but we not got a lot so come early if you want some!

These photos all taken today at Singapore Expo - I was running back and forth to rehearsals while my team worked their butts off on the booth.
The hall is sooooo huuuuuuuge! Bring a good pair of walking shoes and all your money.

I'll be on stage this Sunday for my talk session but will be MC'ing a load of other segments on both days.
I better go and get some kip now - nighty and see you soon!

Oh - if you got a spare pair of boots then please help!
