It's hot, but that doesn't stop the knitting

Los Angeles used to get cool at night. No matter how hot it got during the day, the nights were always cool and crisp.

This weather forecast tells a lie:

YES, it really is that hot during the day, but I have yet to see anything with a 6 in front of it for a low. Those lows are a cruel lie. The coolest temperature recorded in my neighborhood this month was 74, just before dawn a few days ago.

Where did my Los Angeles go? I want my chilly September evenings back!

Nonetheless, I knit onward and upward. Turn up your A/C, friends, because you're still getting hand-knit gifts from the person who takes pictures of her TV weather forecast. Nothing weird at all about that.

Corey, modeling her summertime arm warmers:

These armwarmers were knit using Rowan All Seasons Cotton yarn in a variegated pink colorway. I used a size 8 needle, tight knitters can I get a what what! I don't remember how many stitches I cast on. Just start with a swatch and it will work out.

Once you have the piece long as you like it, seam up the long sides, leaving a little opening for a thumb. SO EASY.

For a little decoration (and to keep the piece polished at the top) I started with a few rows of seed stitch. I love the look of seed stitch finishing anything, a scarf, a hat or a mitten.

I have several armwarmer orders on my to-knit Christmas list, along with a couple of slouchy hats. My personal Christmas wish is that it gets COLD this winter and I get a chance to wear some of the hand-knit goodness stockpiled in my closet.

What's on your holiday knitting to-do list?

And where are you hiding the weather machine that makes the cool nights?

Ha! 60's for a low when your high is above 100 is delusional! When we had 100's this summer our lows were in the 80's. (Washington DC). We have the cool weather machine now and we're not giving it back!

This weather makes me weep -- it's downright tear-inducing! Enough with the humidity already!

I'm currently trying to knit the Margaret Dashwood shawl from this summer's Jane Austen Knits -- in alpaca. Did I mention weeping? Alpapca + Humidity = :-(

We have had the weather machine that makes cool nighs here in Pittsburgh for two nights and I am NOT giving it back till at least November.!

The only holiday knitting I have a planned is a pair of sock for my niece..the same ones I was going to give her last year lol

Today hasn't broken 70 yet, so I'm pretty sure we have the cool weather machine and it is on all the time.

I started work on my holiday presents yesterday, starting with the project I wasn't able to finish last year. Here is hoping that I didn't put it off too long to get it done (and some others) this year.

Posted by: Seanna Lea at September 10, 2012 12:16 PM

I agree with Ellen. I live in Pittsburgh, PA and our lows now are in the 50's, highs in the 80's this week. No more 100's for us... P.S. we are sharing the cool weather machine.

Posted by: Mary Lynn at September 10, 2012 12:18 PM

I can tell you where that weather machine ISN'T: in my apartment in Chatsworth. I didn't know it was so damn hot in the valley before I moved here.

THANKS, HOLLYWOOD, FOR MAKING ME THINK IT WAS PLEASANTLY 75 DEGREES EVERYWHERE IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA ALL THE TIME.

Not that I would have stayed in Maryland anyway.

Posted by: Katharine at September 10, 2012 12:21 PM

OMG!! christmas knitting! YIKES! We are planning to move to RENO, hopefully BEFORE christmas, so I will be cold-winter-land, and I can wear all the sweaters, socks, hats, scarves that I have knit and are collecting dust in my drawer. but I digress, I haven't even begun to think about christmas knitting!

Posted by: Patti at September 10, 2012 12:27 PM

Well, come north, my dear. I left Arcadia and the San Gabriel Valley behind when I graduated from high school long, long ago. I remember many nights between July and October when it was 75 in our screened patio where we often went to sleep when it was 85-90 plus degrees inside the house with no A/C. Up here by the SF Bay, it is very rarely above 65 at night, and when we have a hot spell, I head on up to my son's place in Eureka where the average summertime HIGH is 61 degrees. (Good knitting weather up there all year round!)

Posted by: Gina in the SF Bay Area at September 10, 2012 12:29 PM

Here in Atlanta, we have finally cooled to something below "my ass is on fire" degrees. Low 80's, low 60's at night, and rock bottom humidity. Not that flaming temps have stopped me. I currently have 27 cowls and 15 sets of armwarmers (from one of your posts)stashed in my closet. I have no idea who is going to wear all of this. Last year I had my winter coats cleaned and never wore them - not once all winter. If there is one thing to say about me, it's that once I commit, I am in it. Obsession, ya know?

Posted by: Vicki Salyer at September 10, 2012 12:57 PM

This is the second entry I read tonight. And I am on my third. Got to think which one is next. Thank you.

Posted by: googlepo at September 10, 2012 1:22 PM

My gift knitting list includes two different teddy bears, a couple Tangram puzzles, a slouchy hat, a doll outfit, at least one pair of slippers, a cowl/infinity scarf...plus a couple other things I haven't settled on yet. And to think I was going to take it easy this year!

Posted by: Patti at September 10, 2012 1:28 PM

I have been working really hard to finish or rip out all my works in progress. There are so many that I still have to buy needles anytime I want to knit something new so I've been trying to knock things out.

Knitting, my own version of hording.

I have finished a couple of scarves, one is a chunky infinity scarf which is seen in all the stores right now so I am taking advantage of it and look like one of the cool kids. I am also just finishing up my All Seasons blanket. I've been "working" on this for a couple of years now.

I probably won't knit any presents other than some socks for the women in my family. Most of the family lives in Arizona or Central California where it just doesn't get all that cold. My poor British relatives have more handknits than they will ever be able to wear out. I'll give them a break this year.

Posted by: Laurie at September 10, 2012 1:32 PM

Sorry, the cool weather is in Indiana right now (50's last night, brrr!). I want to do slippers for my great-niece & great-nephew (both two) and I need a small car seat blanket for a new great-niece due in November (I finally started it last weekend!). I think that's it for holiday/birthday knitting.

Posted by: ToniC at September 10, 2012 2:15 PM

Really pretty knitting! Reminds me of mints, or ribbon candy. Nice that you've got a willing model, too! I knit a hat (as a pattern-tester, not for anyone in particular)about two years ago and have yet to get a 3D image of it. Like with a head inside it.

I continue to knit socks and then more socks. I can't explain it. No matter what I cast on, including swatches, just seems to morph into a sock.

Come visit Northern California for some cool knitting and tasty eats.

Glad to see your posts and your good spirits again:)

You got me thinking of that gift knitting, since available time goes by so quickly. Maybe a round of hats for the grumpy IT guys I go to coffee with in the afternoon. You're brilliant! Good knitting to you!

Posted by: elns at September 10, 2012 4:58 PM

I'm halfway through my Christmas knitting with a goal to be finished by mid October. One more hat and a cowl and a half to go and then I'm done. Today it was positively chilly, we actually had a bit of rain early this morning.

Posted by: Toni R. at September 10, 2012 5:58 PM

Christmas knitting! Augghhh! Two pairs of men's socks, a shoulder shawl/scarf, a hat, and something for my mother but I don't know what to make her! That last one has me worried. Sounds like you have a handle on things, and the arm warmers are so pretty! (Btw, I like seed stitch, too. Much better than garter, which for some reason just looks clunky to me. Just my opinion, folks, don't yell at me.)

Posted by: Julie at September 10, 2012 6:10 PM

I'm going through my stash and knitting or crocheting hats. Last year I did this as a stash cleanup and mailed a box of hats to a friend of mine who then redistributed them, and I think it went well so I'm doing it again. Most of them are simple beanies, and I don't worry about care instructions because these are going to someone who knows how to care for handknits (and heck, even if they get destroyed in a washing machine, that's what the next hat box is for!).

Posted by: M.K. at September 10, 2012 6:14 PM

I'm delighted to see you posting again!

Knitting ... maybe I can do some more when the S.O. has finished renovating his house, and I get back an hour a day of commute time and stop having to help him with his renovation. One day. In the meantime, I've packed up a bunch-o-stuff to make room for him at my place because his place has no kitchen. I've forgotten what that stuff is ... but I'm hoping it includes the oven roasting pan. I can't find it anywhere and I wanted to broil something the other day.

His house will be nice ... when it's finished ...

Come to Wisconsin. Eventually it WILL get cold enough for wooly goodness. (This has been the hottest, humid-est summer I can remember, and I am on the shady side of 60.)

Posted by: kmkat at September 11, 2012 5:50 AM

Here in New England the nights have been in the 50s lately (after a brutally hot August) and at the first dip in temperature my knitting came out! I've been making socks lately (a pair with that nifty variegated yarn that I call "Fair Isle for Dummies" and a pair of swirled tube socks). My Christmas knitting list is fairly sock-heavy: tube socks, regular socks, bed socks, crocheted 'fan' bookmarks, a shawl, and a hat. Not too ambitious but at least I'm thinking about it in September and not the day after Thanksgiving.
I adore your blog and never fail to laugh and cry and wonder "Who ARE those people??" with you. Take care!

Posted by: Haworth at September 11, 2012 8:03 AM

Our nights in Wisconsin have been in the 50's. It's so nice to snuggle under a quilt and fall asleep.

Posted by: Molly By Golly at September 11, 2012 8:32 AM

That cool nights machine is up in San Francisco but my son promises to steal it away and bring it down next week. We're taking him down to school at UCLA and he says he needs to bring his night coolness along with him.

Posted by: Donna at September 11, 2012 8:39 AM

So happy to see you back - I missed you! I know you love LA, but here in San Jose we've had the coolest summers ever for the past three years. And our nights usually drop into the 60's and 50's. That's good knitting weather, that is!

Posted by: Juliekaye at September 11, 2012 8:40 AM

Laurie - I also live in SoCal - this is the hottest summer in a long time - I'm done with it - I'm dreaming of Alaska. I'm currently working on a shawl with merino wool - lace weight - so not too hot, but hard to get enthused when it looks like it will never cool off. Also, I want a job like the weather man in which I get paid a lot of money for being wrong 99% of the time :). Glad to see your post - miss you.

Posted by: Marla at September 11, 2012 9:07 AM

Our cool weather machine has only been working in fits & starts. Doesn't matter, as I knit on anyway! I'm considering arm warmers this year, as the go-to giftable for the holidays. I've done hats & cowls, and nothing at all (some years it just can't be borne...), but no-one at work seems to mind anyway. So, I'll likely work up about 8-9 pairs of arm-warmers, but only work on those when some other knitting is kicking my assets.

Posted by: CeltChick at September 11, 2012 9:45 AM

Socks for my mother and sister, mittens at least for my brother-in-law (if I can ever figure out the pattern!), and a watch cap for my husband, to match a scarf I made him a few years back. I'm keeping it simple this year!

After MONTHS and MONTHS of hot, dry weather (in the 100's, and no rain at all - - we are right in the middle of the severe drought portion of the country) we are finally starting to get some decent temps. Upper 70's to mid-80's during the day, 50's at night. And blessed, blessed rain!

So if you don't mind, I would like to hang on to the weather machine just a bit longer, just until we get the water levels back up to where my well doesn't run dry.....

I'm so glad someone else noticed the weather lies! No way it hit 6-anything for well over a month if not 2! It's hellish. And OM, Christmas knitting? Just the thought of touching wool makes me want to lay in front of the window AC unit! Like your pinkies!

Hot out here in the Bay Area as well. Thank goodness for air conditioning.

I want to start finishing my backpack, crochet my infinity scarf, and try and see if I can make some mocassions.

Really like that pink by the way.

Posted by: z at September 11, 2012 5:59 PM

I may only knit for the two new babies in my life, my one year old great-nephew, and my god-daughter's soon to be born little girl. Everyone else can wait until next year! And LOVEY pink arm warmers...and yes, you may want to try knitting in the round, saves on that nasty seaming thing.

Posted by: Sally M at September 11, 2012 6:32 PM

Finally picked up my crochet needle after a long break from it...having a passion right now for making hats! I made a razorback hat (I live in Arkansas...we are the razorbacks) this weekend as a gift for a friend having a baby...it turned out so cute and she loves it. So thinking my grandkids will be getting hats for Christmas. Fall blew in here last Sat! After temps in the 100s all last week, a storm blew thru Friday and it's been wonderful ever since...highs in the 80s and lows in the 60s. What a relief from a LONG hot, scary dry, miserable summer!

Posted by: groovygranny at September 11, 2012 7:56 PM

Sorry, I think we are having El Nino again this year! It's been hot in Portland too and I fear another mild (ok, milder than usual!) winter here. Probly doesn't bode well for LA, either. Good thing you're gettin' Christmas mojo on now! ;)

My winter knitting project is a fancy purse, to be knit on self ruffling yarn. It scares me at this point since I haven't started. But, best of all, I got some self ruffling "yarn" in a leopard print chiffon. Again, scared of it a little bit, but oooh la la what an amazing leopard purse.

One of my addictions is reading your post everyday. It's been a very sad few months without you. I just finished "I Feel Bad About My Neck" by Nora Ephrom, which reminded me a lot of your writing and humor. I enjoyed it almost as much as "Home is Where the Wine is"..(almost). So thats why I thought of you and what a surprise to see you back, twice in one week.
Thank-you, you were missed.

Posted by: sheila at September 12, 2012 9:38 AM

Haha, I was wondering why everyone is posting multiple times. I hit "Post" and nothing happens for a minute or so (seems like 5). Instead of hitting Post again, like many did,I waited it out and then it posts. Whew.

Posted by: sheila at September 12, 2012 9:42 AM

1st: Please keep posting! You and the Yarn Harlot keep me sane and she's been carrying the load alone for a while. :)
2nd: I'm with the person above who wants to finish LAST YEARS knitting, except in my case it might go back more than a year. :(
Pretty arm warmers. Currently looking for the "perfect" big cowl pattern. Like I don't have enough to do, ha ha.

Posted by: Judy in MT at September 12, 2012 9:42 AM

Fall fell here on Saturday night -- it was hot & humid when I went to bed, and the morning was FREEZING.
The winter's project is my first-ever pair of socks. I completed one toe last winter and then lost the bag. It's turned up again, so here I go!
Thanks for pointing me towards variegated yarn - you were right, and it really does hide everything. Call it Febreeze for a novice knitter. (I can't knit at an even tension yet and I'm doing socks!)

Posted by: MaryHS in Central CT at September 12, 2012 10:36 AM

I love armwarmers or wristwarmers knit that way.


Also, I was soooo tempted just to comment, "In my pants!" and leave it at that. I have no idea why; I think lack of sleep makes me think I'm funnier than I am.

Hi Laurie,
My last Christmas knitting wasn't finished on time. I wrapped the size 35 needles and pile of cream colored yarn into a box with a bow. When my Dad opened the box everyone had a what the ... moment until they realized it was an afgan (4 strands knit into a box pattern, kind of like your magic scarf pattern). That was a long time ago, but the afgan lives on in my brothers house, still a comfort to all that snuggle under it. If I knit a wearable for anyone I need a label that says yes I made it, no you can't return it.

Posted by: Colleen at September 13, 2012 6:32 AM

It is finally cooler (and beautiful) here in VA. I actually had to get up during the night and close the window! When I lived in the LA area a few years ago, I was shocked every summer (April-Nov) that I had to ADD 10 degrees to the tv temps for LA to get the real temp for our valley. And about knitting gifts? I made myself a scarf (I usually always knit for others)but when I tried it on I realized it is way to scratchy to wear near my skin. Sigh. So I am pulling out the sewing machine for Christmas gifts. I am disillusioned with knitting these days. No one can appredaite the work that goes into a nice present unless they knit themselves. And if they knit themselves, they can make the simple hat or scarf that I am capable of.

Posted by: Gretchen at September 13, 2012 6:34 AM

I forgot to add - 102 days till Christmas. (And even less if you need to mail the gifts!)

Posted by: Gretchen at September 13, 2012 6:38 AM

We recently visited SanFran and I thought of you (I know that's far from LA but I am from Toronto so that makes it close) and when I checked today to see if you'd written anything it was a nice surprise.
It's 17°C here (so, like, 62/63° F) and what I really should do is actually finish some of my UFO's. Since taking up quilting in the new year, my knitting bag has been gathering dust...

Posted by: Toni at September 16, 2012 1:52 PM

Happy to see that you're blogging again!

I'm doing itty-bitty sweaters for my 1yo great-nephew and my 3-month-old grandson, and a ginormous thank-god-for-cascade-128 sweater for my favorite nephew. (I think he'd still be my favorite even if he werent my only nephew.)

My easy-peasy gift for my peeps everywhere is coffee/beer/coke coziness, knitted just like a ribbed sweater cuff. Make 'em in leftover superwash worsted. Extra points if you overdye fugly colors with koolaid and get that stuff outta your stash.

Or if it's too hot for hats where you live, knit some washable hats in dark colors and send em to a homeless shelter someplace cold. Or make smaller, bright-colored versions and send them to a school in a poor neighborhood. Everyone should have hand knitted goodness at least once.

My wish for 2013 is to wheedle down my stash enough to make room in my closet for clothes and shoes.

I just figured out the Magic Cast On, people. Socks! Socks for everyone!!!! Even my nephew, who is pushing 40. Maybe my brother, who rarely wears anything but flip-flops.

great points altogether, you just gained a new reader. What would you suggest in regards to your post that you made some days ago? Any positive?

Posted by: Maryann Murphy at September 22, 2012 3:06 PM

There's always so much going on at a meet-up that it's easy to make mieatkss. I spent the whole time frogging my mistake (that I'd made BEFORE I went) and then knitting back up and one row past where I'd started. So much for completing the darn thing! However remember it's the process that counts, right? Sure. Uh-huh.Hope 3rd time was lucky!

The weather here in LA, it is a little-known fact, is the fault of my friend Loretta in NYC. She came out in July, when LA was still was LA (unseasonably cool, even, delightful to me). She complained, "Where is the high heat and low humidity LA is famous for? I love heat!"

Then she went back to NYC, and BAM! that's when it hit. She didn't come out to visit -- she came out to hex us, and plop some of her NY heat and humidity on us. I've begged, threatened, bribed with knitted goods (scarf, hat, and mitts), to get her to come take it back, to no avail.

My next threat is to publish her location, mwa hahahaha!

I have to say, while looking through hundreds of blogs daily, the theme of this blog is different (for all the proper reasons). If you do not mind me asking, what's the name of this theme or would it be a especially designed affair? It's significantly better compared to the themes I use for some of my blogs.
Welcome to my website www.about-dogs.zoomshare.com.

OMG, I've missed your blog so much! I am in the thick of the holiday knitting. Mostly fair isle hats and maybe a few scarves and/or shawls thrown in the mix. It's nice and cold here in Colorado. It actually got to freezing temps the other night! After a VERY hot dry Summer that also involved wildfires and part of my city being on fire, I'm really, REALLY grateful for the cold weather!

Oooh, the lightbulb overhead just went on: Maybe some of my giftable friends would like armwarmers for holiday this year? Very simple, hopefully very quick, and not a)hats or b)cowls (which I've done to death). Not holding my breath for the next post, but will look forward to it just the same!

Posted by: CeltChick at October 11, 2012 9:03 AM

Posted by: Judith Ann Mcdermott at October 15, 2012 6:28 AM

Great arm warmers! Really cool stuff. I am amazed with both it's functionality and stylish. Many leg warmers can even be converted for arm wear, versatile for changeable conditions. Simple yet effective.
