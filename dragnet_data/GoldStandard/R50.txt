Open Or Closed
There's a weird genre on the twitter of people chastising local businesses for staying open during the storm. I don't think there's any right or wrong here, though certainly employers shouldn't be assholes and force people who are worried about a safe commute to come to work. But, you know, people work because they want/need money. Tip well.
