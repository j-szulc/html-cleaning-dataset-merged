Large Pond + Zipline + Wakeboard = Awesome!

Here’s a dream come true for all you wakeboarding fans: ride all day without a boat, fumes, or gasoline.  These two guys used a zipline attached to towers set at each side of a large private pond to make it happen. Check it out:

The towers are 140 yards apart which allows for a 120-yard wakeboarding run. The line is computer controlled through a laptop which reads and controls the speed, position, and direction of the line (it can also be set for a predetermined number of ski runs back and forth).  All it needs is an operator on shore to push the ‘go’ button and the computer does the rest.   Check out more details on the project.
