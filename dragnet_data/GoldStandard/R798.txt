Noble Toy Company Brings It Home
Wooden playthings made in the USA

There’s nothing more American than bitching about plastic toys made in China.

Except maybe Noble Toy Company, a new business specializing in made-in-the-USA wooden playthings.

The upstart launched with exquisite maple blocks that double as a six-sided puzzle. Every six to eight weeks it will add another back-to-basics trinket to its mix. We got a sneak peek at what’s next — a memory game and spinning tops — and can tell you the toys are elegant enough to leave on a coffee table but mesh perfectly with a kid’s stash.

Wondering what’s behind this venture? Founder Chris Huizenga was inspired by a trip to his childhood home. Grandma broke out an old wooden train set, his toddler son went gaga, and the rest, as they say, is American history.

Available at noble-toys.com, $45-$200.
