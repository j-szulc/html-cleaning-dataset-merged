Faculty position at Waterloo
Experimental philosophers nicely fit the description for this position in the Center for Knowledge Integration at the University of Waterloo (Ontario), and I'm told that such applications would definitely be of interest. Waterloo has a robust cognitive science program, several researchers actively working in x-phi, an inclusive and diverse philosophy department, and CKI truly values interdisciplinarity and methodological innovation.
