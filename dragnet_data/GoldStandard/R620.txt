The World Needs More Love Letters

Istare at the blank card, lost for words. Why is this so difficult? Isn’t this what I do when I sit at a keyboard and blog, share a piece of my heart, hoping to connect with women I may never meet? But these words will only reach one. How do you shoot an arrow at an unknown target?

With prayer.

Lord, bless the woman who finds this letter and give me the words she needs to hear. Amen.

*  *  *  *  *  *

My oldest daughter wants to show me a project she’s started. She’s struggled lately and it weighs on me. “Go to MoreLoveLetters.com,” she  asks and I comply, eager to know the source of the light I see in her eyes. We watch this video and read these stories while tears slip down my face.

And I understand. 


{Subscribers, click here to watch.}

Later as we walk towards the door at T.J. Maxx she slips away whispering, “I’m going to put a letter in The Hunger Games,” and I nod, imagining who will find it . . .

My mother told me once that she worried about me. “You’re only as happy as your least happy child,” she spoke, knowing the chances that mine would all be happy seemed slim. She’s been gone over 8 years now, but the wisdom of her words rings true as my children age.

This daughter writes down how she feels in words. They hurt her to write and me to read: Useless. Hopeless.

“The antidote for feeling useless is to be useful,” I scribble in this journal where we write back and forth. “And one way to battle hopelessness is to bring hope to others. These letters you’re writing? They’re useful. They bring hope.” 

I don’t see her read my words, but I know that she, too, understands. {Sometimes the girl who needs encouragement the most is the ones who does the most encouraging.}


“It is a surreal feeling, to compose a letter to an individual that you have no ties to but at the same time you want the whole wide world for them. I wished them a bright day. A day full of laughter. I told them they were unique & special & really quite smashing. (I might not have used the word ‘smashing’ but I probably will in the next letter.) Really, we are not told enough, in a genuine noncommercial manner, how brilliant we are. How intriguing and wonderful we are. How much we should be commended for waking up today and deciding to take on the task of being human. It is not an easy task. It is not always fun. But it is wildly worth it. Better that we write all these things down.” October 10, 2010 (from moreloveletters.com)

I hear these stories, and I want to be a part of it; I want the Lord to use me to speak words of encouragement into eager ears.

Lord help me make a difference.

The Lord answers my prayers today as the words flow from hand to page and I take design inspiration from scrapbook paper and a perfume box. My tools: a set of markers, a pair of scissors, and a glue stick.

Who will find this? I don’t know, but I’ve prayed for her.

    2 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 6:57 AM

        Tami, that means a lot to me.

        
    3 Dasha Tatarinov November 7, 2012 at 11:17 AM

        Wow, what a great idea. Thankuyoi for the inspiration, im going to attempt to make a letter myself and give it to a random someone at my college.

        

        4 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 10:55 PM

            Dasha, there’s a program called Campus Cursive for colleges: http://www.moreloveletters.com/campus-cursive-app/

            

    5 Pinksmack.com November 7, 2012 at 3:55 PM

        I agree…this is such a Simple yet Awesome idea and I think this is what we need right now in our country. I can’t wait to start!

        

6 kendal November 7, 2012 at 5:54 AM

    wow. just wow. and i’m instantly wanting to incorporate this into my public school classroom.

    

    7 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 6:57 AM

        Kendal, I think that’s an incredible idea!

        

8 Erica November 7, 2012 at 6:27 AM

    Hmmm… I’ll have to check this out. Thanks for sharing with us! I love love love the idea of journaling back and forth with your daughter. What a blessing for you both!

    

    9 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 6:58 AM

        Erica, I’m not as faithful with the journal as I should be, but it’s been a good thing. I’ve got one for each of my kids. Most of them are waiting on my reply now . . . :)

        

10 Natasha d November 7, 2012 at 6:32 AM

    well said, Dawn! Thank you for your inspiration in this area! ….and just getting back to writing letters and sending them in the mail with encouragement and inspiration, if it is a stranger or not!!

    

    11 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 6:58 AM

        Natasha, a friend told me recently that a “real” card just makes her feel loved. I agree!

        

12 Janet November 7, 2012 at 6:36 AM

    Such a beautiful thing! Thank you for introducing us to this.

    

    13 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 6:58 AM

        You’re welcome!

        

14 ~va~ November 7, 2012 at 6:45 AM

    Oh wow, that is a really cool idea!

    

    15 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 6:59 AM

        I thought so, too. Glad to share!

        

16 Ginger November 7, 2012 at 7:00 AM

    This is wonderful!! I do something similar with my 5 year old boys called Hide & Seek hearts. (http://letsgivetoday.com/tag/hide-and-seek-hearts/) I love the idea of encouraging strangers and letting them know they are loved!

    
17 Cindy November 7, 2012 at 7:15 AM

    I am a letter writer and card writer so this is perfect for me. I am so happy to hear of this. Thank you.

    
18 Jo-Anne November 7, 2012 at 7:23 AM

    LOVE LOVE LOVE this idea, it came at the right time where I know I can get my girlfriends involved when we have our Christmas gathering :) Thanks so much for sharing!

    

    19 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 10:56 PM

        Jo-Anne, that’s a great plan for your Christmas gathering!

        

20 Caroline November 7, 2012 at 7:49 AM

    I love this idea. It is like a RACK but u never know who will receive it. I am joining the Love Letter movement.

    
21 sarah November 7, 2012 at 8:14 AM

    I am doing this!!! So beautiful and so amazing!! I can think of many times in my life where finding one of these would have meant the world to me. Thank you for bringing this to our attention!!

    

    22 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 10:57 PM

        Sarah, I think you’ve hit on the best motivation: knowing how much this could have meant to you at times in your life.

        

23 Jennie November 7, 2012 at 8:25 AM

    I love this idea. My daughter would love this too. She is young but she is such an instrument of encouragement. Just last night she left a note for her older brother. She too is one who needs a lot of encouragement herself. Thanks for that reminder. I will be praying for your daughter too. What gifts we have been given. I pray God continues to use our children to teach us.

    

    24 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 10:57 PM

        Jennie, you are so right. God certainly uses our children to teach us.

        

25 Brittany November 7, 2012 at 8:25 AM

    This is a truly wonderful idea! I think everybody, no matter who or where they are, needs some extra love & encouragement sometimes. We all have bad days and to find a letter like this on one of those days would never be forgotten. Thankyou so much for sharing this! xo

    
26 Melanie November 7, 2012 at 9:12 AM

    What a special way to encourage. The Lord knows who will find each note and what they need to hear. We just need to let our hands be His instrument of encouragement.

    

    27 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 10:58 PM

        Yes! The hands of Jesus. :)

        

28 Amy Lugar November 7, 2012 at 9:22 AM

    I am inspired

    
29 Lisa-Jo@incourage November 7, 2012 at 9:23 AM

    I love this so much. Makes me want to go and open every copy of the Hunger Games, just in case :)

    

    30 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 11:00 PM

        :)

        

31 Trisha November 7, 2012 at 9:55 AM

    This is one of those posts that makes me say, “Why didn’t I think of that?”! I love this idea and am planning on buying some blank cards this weekend. This is perfect and just in time for Christmas. How amazing would it be to receive a double blessing, opening a Christmas gift and finding an encouraging letter inside as well!

    Love it!

    
32 Amy K-W November 7, 2012 at 10:01 AM

    {Sometimes the girl who needs encouragement the most is the ones who does the most encouraging.} So true, so true!

    
33 Terrilea November 7, 2012 at 10:17 AM

    I love writing notes and can’t wait to start writing love letters…wonderful, loving idea!

    
34 Melissa November 7, 2012 at 10:17 AM

    I’ve been thinking a lot about love lately and how I can give my love to the world. Perfect piece at the right time. Everyone deserves love and encouragement. Thank you, I hope to start this this holiday season.

    
35 Julie S. November 7, 2012 at 10:18 AM

    What a great idea! I love this and since the holiday season of frazzle and stress is upon us, I think this is the perfect time to do it! Thank you!

    
36 ninaruth November 7, 2012 at 10:18 AM

    Dawn, thanks for this reminder and confirmation of the importance of AFFIRMATION!! About two months ago, God gave me the idea to make a blessing box for a friend…each day asking God for a single word and writing it on a piece of paper (decorating it & making it lovely); a word that described this person, and then writing a corresponding verse on the back. But, doubt began creeping in and I wondered if it was a silly idea. Your post encouraged me and reminded me that, yes, sometimes it’s the encouragers who could use a bit of encouragemencouragement!! :-)

    

    37 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 11:01 PM

        I think your blessing box is a wonderful idea!

        

38 Moriah@HomeOnTheErieCanal November 7, 2012 at 10:19 AM

    I love that idea!!! :~D

    Definitely will research it!

    
39 Karen November 7, 2012 at 10:25 AM

    I joined the monthly dayspring card club about a year ago and I have sat and wondered who I would send all these cards to. Some days I think I will send church family birthday cards and anniversary cards and I know that is good but it doesn’t go into my heart like I want it to. I have been thinking and thinking who I could send cards to and then I think after attending allume that I am going to start getting addresses from my online friends and start sending snail mail cards because who wouldn’t like a card but and this feels right……………..but then your post comes……………and I see now why nothing has felt right yet. I am going to join in this journey of writing love letters. Thank you for telling us about it. This is what God had me waiting for!

    

    40 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 11:02 PM

        Karen, you just made me cry. Seriously. Thank you for these words.

        

41 Elaine November 7, 2012 at 10:26 AM

    Dawn, I’ve just been to the more love letters site, but I’m confused. HOW does one leave these love letters? Is there a central location/site to find people who need a letter? I’d love to do this, but I don’t know how it works!

    

    42 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 11:05 PM

        Elaine, you can write single letters and leave them places anonymously (I left mine tucked inside a book at Barnes and Noble) or you can sign up with a group of people through moreloveletters.com to write a bundle of 10 cards, which go to a specific person. If you sign up on the site you’ll be sent the name and circumstance of the person who you’ll write the letters to, and then you send them in (you’ll get the address, too) and they’ll be sent to that person. Make sense?

        

43 Rebekah Lyon November 7, 2012 at 10:27 AM

    As an encourager I am SO IN LOVE with this idea! Can’t wait to get started. Thank you! Just fabulous!

    

    44 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 11:07 PM

        It’s great for either encouragers or those who need encouraged. :)

        

45 Jill Werner November 7, 2012 at 10:29 AM

    What a wonderful idea! Thank you so much for sharing.

    
46 Nadine November 7, 2012 at 10:29 AM

    Oh my, dear Dawn, that’s a wonderful, exciting thing, thank You sooo much for sharing it with us ! The world needs more – more love letters. And more people like You, who do not only use, but also share the love and compassion that is found at sometimes unobtrusively places.

    Prayers and Blessings for You and Your daughter (:

    
47 Luisa November 7, 2012 at 10:34 AM

    This is such a wonderful idea! I always say people don’t give each other enough compliments and letters of encouragement and love is a great way to do so. I’m going to get the girls I volunteer with at church to do some letters with me.

    
48 Debbie November 7, 2012 at 10:35 AM

    God is so good! What a blessing you have to share with your daughter.
    I have sent out cards to women I have met in Bible study and womens groups but to send a card to a perfect stranger is a wonderful idea. God always rewards with feeling so encouraged myself after sending a card. This is a great time of year to send a card of encouragement to someone you hear who is unemployed or going through a struggle. It will be a joy to get a group of ladies together and write cards. Wonderful idea – Thanks for sharing this!

    
49 Mandy November 7, 2012 at 10:36 AM

    This is an amazing idea. I love it!

    
50 Michelle Kendall November 7, 2012 at 10:42 AM

    This is awesome! I am so checking it out and going to do this!!! This is such an awesome way to be the light God has called us to be.

    
51 Jules November 7, 2012 at 10:44 AM

    What a great opportunity to share Jesus who is our hope!!! Yes I’ll do it!!!

    
52 Amanda November 7, 2012 at 10:50 AM

    What a wonderful idea this is! I can’t wait to get started!

    
53 Maureen November 7, 2012 at 10:51 AM

    I am inspired. Going to share the idea with my 11 yr son and make it our “thing’

    
54 Teish November 7, 2012 at 10:53 AM

    What a wonderful idea! Just imagine the possibilities!

    
55 Angela November 7, 2012 at 10:57 AM

    Thank you for sharing! I absolutely love this idea and cant wait to get started!

    
56 Angela November 7, 2012 at 10:58 AM

    Thank you for sharing! I absolutely love this idea !

    
57 Holly November 7, 2012 at 10:58 AM

    Wow, what a wonderful idea! I have sent notes with my girls when they go on retreat, or to camp, that they would have encouragement each day…but to extend that to someone that God knows, that God places in that spot to find it…

    Thank you for sharing, and I look forward to talking with my daughters about this and see what they say…!

    
58 Angela November 7, 2012 at 10:58 AM

    Thank you for sharing! I absolutely love this idea!

    
59 Angie November 7, 2012 at 10:59 AM

    Completely awesome! I love this site and and the love-sharing! Can’t wait to give it a try. Thanks for this post!

    
60 Terri November 7, 2012 at 11:05 AM

    I just found your website today and I just LOVE it! It is so encouraging, which is something I try to be. You give me more direction and reason to be…especially in this day and time! I also send cards to others; but, I make my own as the “store bought” ones have gotten so expensive! I look at it as investment in others’ happiness!

    
61 Renee Ortiz November 7, 2012 at 11:07 AM

    Neat-O! I can hardly wait to share this idea with my daughter!…. And my servant evangelism team… And my mom… And and and …

    
62 Lynne November 7, 2012 at 11:08 AM

    What an absolutely amazing concept, and how easy to do! Please tell your daughter that she has inspired a lot of people today, and really opened the door for many more people other than the ones that find her letters to be encouraged. It’s the old ripple in a pond effect….I hope both of you have a great week.

    
63 Ruth November 7, 2012 at 11:11 AM

    Intriguing. I will explore the concept more.

    
64 Christina burrell November 7, 2012 at 11:16 AM

    I love giving and receiving cards.

    
65 Sherri November 7, 2012 at 11:23 AM

    I love receiving personal notes and letters! It seems like in today’s technology world we forget how sweet it is to write things down so people have a lasting memory of our feelings. The other day I found the first birthday card I gave my husband in a book. It was so sweet and hilarious to see what card I picked out and the words I had written.

    Great idea!!!

    
66 shana November 7, 2012 at 11:28 AM

    this is right up my alley. count me in. i love it! thanks for the introduction!
    blessings,
    shana

    
67 Karen November 7, 2012 at 11:35 AM

    The concept of writing Love letters so resonates with me!! I am a writer of letters already. I resist/detest texts and e-mails as opposed to a hand written note or letter. This inspires me anew to do more to encourage others. Thank you!

    
68 Melissa November 7, 2012 at 11:42 AM

    I love to write letters! Bless you and your daughters for spreading love!

    
69 Jen @ Martymom's Musings November 7, 2012 at 11:43 AM

    This is such a beautiful endeavor. I have been pondering the lost art of letter writing recently and then I read this. This world could use more love letters.

    I just love this and I plan to share this with others and get involved. It just so awesome!

70 Leah November 7, 2012 at 11:57 AM

    Thanks for the inspiration. At the least, I will now be writing letters for children.

    
71 staci wells mefford November 7, 2012 at 11:58 AM

    i love the inspiration givng personalized items and helping others

    
72 emanuela olariu November 7, 2012 at 12:03 PM

    I write cards for the women’s ministry team at our church. I dont always know the ladies that i write the cards too, but i pray that God will use me as an instrument to brighten their day. I love the thought that in a pille of bills some is going to get a dayspring card and that’s maybe all they need to smile that day. Thank you for the code. God bless!

    
73 Amy Kissel November 7, 2012 at 12:04 PM

    I just wrote a post on my blog about being thankful for those who give and how we can give. I think this is a wonderful way to give – even when you don’t have ‘stuff’ or money to give! Thank you!

    
74 Robyn November 7, 2012 at 12:11 PM

    What a fantastic idea! I’ve posted a link to the video on my Facebook page asking for 10 friends to join me in “adopting a bundle.”

    
75 Sheri November 7, 2012 at 12:13 PM

    I love this, so inspiring and so special. I have tried to instill in my children the importance of writing snail mail, a truly forgotten art in our age of technology. Thank you for sharing.

    
76 Kathy A. November 7, 2012 at 12:16 PM

    God’s timing is always perfect and I am so very grateful for that today! I struggle with depression and have those feelings of uselessness and hopelessness often…but at this moment I am excitedly holding on to the reminder that “the antidote for feeling useless is to be useful”…. “and one way to battle hopelessness is to bring hope to others.” Thank you so very much for sharing this….and blessings to your and your daughter as you continue to bring hope and encouragement to others! :)

    
77 Amber November 7, 2012 at 12:17 PM

    This is fabulous! I am so excited to start this and share it with others!

    
78 Jennifer N November 7, 2012 at 12:18 PM

    Such a beautiful inspiring post!

    
79 Lori November 7, 2012 at 12:19 PM

    I especially needed to hear the part about how encouraging others REALLY encourages the one encouraging — this is a tough day for me on the “emo-meter”, and this sounds like a perfect antidote to get me started back to the joyful side! Working at a university, I have plenty of young people around me every day who need to hear these kinds of things as well. I’m gonna recruit the ladies in my office to take part and we’ll definitely get something started here! Thank you so much!!!

    
80 Kim November 7, 2012 at 12:26 PM

    what a great idea!

    
81 Jamie November 7, 2012 at 12:31 PM

    Yes, this. Exactly this. It is what our world needs. Thanks so much for sharing. I’m both inspired and encouraged. Today I will write a letter for a stranger and one for my daughter away at college too.

    
82 Kristen November 7, 2012 at 12:32 PM

    Love. This. Idea. Off to go write my first one!!

    
83 Carmen November 7, 2012 at 12:34 PM

    This sounds like a great idea! I’ll have to make up some letters.

    
84 Karen November 7, 2012 at 12:38 PM

    This is such a beautiful idea. I can’t wait to start.

    
85 Anne November 7, 2012 at 12:40 PM

    Thank you for sharing! Great way to spread love.

    
86 Katie B November 7, 2012 at 12:42 PM

    Wow… just reading this encouraged me!! God has recently put it on my heart to begin writing – what a perfect way to begin! I am going to the Philippines next week and have been dreading the long flight… I now have something to look forward to! What a perfect time to begin the letters! What a blessing. :)

    
87 Beth Williams November 7, 2012 at 12:46 PM

    You will never know how much I need encouragement–especially now with my aging father & work stresses. All of this is just getting a bit much for me.

    Still, though, I will encourage others. I want them to feel loved, appreciated, beautiful, useful–A CHILD OF THE KING!

    God Bless!

    
88 Morgan Alexander November 7, 2012 at 12:52 PM

    So true! Love this! :)

    
89 H.G. November 7, 2012 at 12:55 PM

    This is absolutely beautiful! Thank you for the inspiration and the reminder that everyone is special and in need of encouragement. God bless!

    
90 Kelly Lake November 7, 2012 at 1:04 PM

    I love love love this! I am a card buyer, maker, writer and sender! For birthdays, sick friends, encouragement, etc….but I love the idea of leaving cards for someone annonymously! Wonderful, thank you so much for this brilliant idea!
    Blessings,
    Kelly

    
91 kristin November 7, 2012 at 1:11 PM

    what a fantabulous idea! can’t wait to get started!

    
92 Shelly R November 7, 2012 at 1:13 PM

    Thank you for sharing this… this school year my daughter and I have started sending cards and letters at least once a week to those we know. Because in this world of the internet and social media, she Is learning to communicate through screens. i am trying to teach her the lost art of letter writing. What a fabulous idea to take that a step further.

    
93 Stephanie November 7, 2012 at 1:17 PM

    Thank you for this opportunity! I love Dayspring cards. They are SO much fun to share with my friends :)

    
94 Erin November 7, 2012 at 1:17 PM

    What an absolutely simple and amazingly complex idea!!! Going to find out more…

    
95 Phronsie November 7, 2012 at 1:22 PM

    I have using my card stash for our church women’s prison ministry. I’d love to add more cards to my supply!

    
96 A MOM November 7, 2012 at 1:35 PM

    I love writing letters!

    
97 Kate November 7, 2012 at 1:41 PM

    Thank you so much for this!

    
98 Susan G November 7, 2012 at 1:48 PM

    I have never heard of this, and so glad you have shared this with all of us. I have always loved writing letters and sending them ‘snail mail’, so hearing about writing ‘love letters’ to strangers warms my heart. What a truly awesome way to ‘love’ people and encourage someone. After the election last night, I really need to read a ‘love letter’…
    Thanks so much!
    Susan G.

    
99 Missy November 7, 2012 at 1:51 PM

    That God used inspired this young woman to make such a huge impact on her world. Our world. It’s a beautiful thing to witness. And to be a part of. Thank you for sharing this!

    Love, love, love this! I’m worried about the line as you are only as happy as your least happy child. That hits close to home….

    I love this idea and can’t wait to join the movement.

    Wow! What a wonderful, awesome, amazing idea. I am taking this and using it today! How long has it been since I connected on paper with someone – I have no idea. Today I write my first letter in many many years.

    This is a touch of God in someone’s life. Have always felt the call to surprise and brighten the days of those who I didn’t even know by touching their lives with God’s deep love for them. Truly a wonderful reminder to press on with this ministry. MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU!!

    What a great idea … there are so many hurting people out there who feel alone. They walk with a smile in their face but a broken hearts. Thank you for sharing, and will try to involve my son to do this with me.

    What a great idea !! I will have to check it out soon. :-)

    
105 Karen Looby November 7, 2012 at 2:33 PM

    I love this idea! I’m going to try it using my handmade cards. This would be a great thing to teach our children as well.

    
106 LaDonna November 7, 2012 at 2:56 PM

    I’m in. I love to encourage others. I am especially excited when someone encourages me as well. I do believe we try hard in areas that we are needing ourselves. I will also pray for your daughter.

    Thanks so much for sharing this article. I was so encouraging and inspiring to me. My mother passed away 1 year ago and she was a letter writer, mostly thank you card. I am reminded of the importance of writing letter and being on the receiving end as well. I am going to go write a letter to someone.

    
108 Lisa November 7, 2012 at 3:38 PM

    This is such a great idea! I can’t wait for my 14 year old daughter to get home from school to share this with her. This is something uplifting we can do together.

    
109 leanna November 7, 2012 at 3:49 PM

    I just love this!

    
110 Brittany November 7, 2012 at 3:54 PM

    Wow this is amazing, so glad to find out about this. I know some people that could use a love letter and I love the item of surprising a stranger with one. Thanks so much for the chance to win as well!

    
111 Danielle November 7, 2012 at 4:15 PM

    What a beautifully simple idea to share love and encouragement with someone you may never meet but who needs to know how special they are, just like we all do! I absolutely adore this idea. I am going to share it with my group of friends that I do a Bible study with on Monday nights. What an encouragement our little group of 7 could be to so many people!!!

    
112 Cat November 7, 2012 at 4:26 PM

    What a fabulous concept!!! So doing this!!

    Dawn – thank you for sharing.

    “How much we should be commended for waking up today and deciding to take on the task of being human.”

    Great words – It reminds me of a quote from Marcus Aurelius. (Paraphrasing) ‘Each day I get up to do the work of a human being.”

    There’s power in pride for what you do each day. As you correctly point out it starts with love. Knowing that you are loved (for all your strengths and weaknesses) allows you to make independent well thought through decisions.

    
114 Janine November 7, 2012 at 5:50 PM

    Great idea!!

    
115 Kim November 7, 2012 at 5:52 PM

    I love how you write back and forth in a journal with your daughter. That is a powerful and seriously underutilized means of holding conversations with kids, IMHO. :-)

    Thanks for sharing this great organization with us!

    
116 Holly B November 7, 2012 at 6:24 PM

    I puffy-heart love this!! <3

    And a note to Ninaruth, I love your idea too!! Thank you for another inspiring idea. The blessing box would be like receiving a lot of kisses from our Heavenly Daddy.

    About a week ago, I bought a bunch of “32 Messages of God’s Love” by Day Spring on sale at Walmart. (Can I say that?) Dawn, I must ask, were these inspired by the “Love Letter” project????? I kept thinking, what will I do with all these powerful little messages. Well, I gave the first two to my daughters, which was tucked away in their Thankful Journal, when they found it the next morning their smile was HUUUUUUGE :) I can only imagine the impact it may have on a complete stranger. Now, I know what to do with the rest of them, yay! God had a plan and led me here :) Thank you lots!!!!

    

    119 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 11:19 PM

        H, I had no idea about the “32 Messages of God’s Love” cards—I’m going to look for those!

        

120 Julie November 7, 2012 at 7:30 PM

    i’ve never heard of this movement before. thanks for introducing it to me.

    
121 BeccyH November 7, 2012 at 8:14 PM

    My baby girl went away to college in August and I promised her to write her a letter or handmade card every week, just like I did for her older brother. Their generation not being the letter writers of mine LOVED getting those little reminders from home. When I found out that several of her friends don’t get the chance to go to their mailbox, I started writing them too. Just a note to wish them well on the upcoming week, praises and well wishes when the team wins (and loses) or just to say hi. I never thought that sending those letters and cards would have the impact they do. I now keepin touch with 7 UofA freshmen who crave just a note from home. Thank you for spreading the joys of the written word.

    

    122 Dawn Camp November 7, 2012 at 11:20 PM

        BeccyH, you are *amazing*! This is wonderful work that you’re doing impacting these young lives.

        

123 Kelly McNamara November 7, 2012 at 8:23 PM

    I LOVE THIS!
    I have a heart for encouraging women….and this is a way to reach more of them!
    Thank you for sharing this idea/website!

    
124 Liesl November 7, 2012 at 9:26 PM

    What a cool thing!! As someone whose love language is “words of affirmation,” I can totally see how this could turn someone’s day (or even life) around. I’d never heard of this, but am so on board :)

    
125 Leah November 7, 2012 at 9:28 PM

    This is so fantastic….thank you so much for sharing!

    
126 Narah November 8, 2012 at 12:25 AM

    What a great concept! So simple, yet so needed.

    
127 Joanna Warren November 8, 2012 at 6:23 AM

    What a great way to share the love of Christ!

    
128 Suzanne G. November 8, 2012 at 7:33 AM

    LOVE this idea. Hand written notes and cards have almost disappeared with technology advances. I love receiving a hand written note, it is such an encouragement!!

    
129 Kristen November 8, 2012 at 7:57 AM

    Loved.This.

    The kids and I began to create last night, with so much joy and excitement!

    
130 Dee November 8, 2012 at 8:51 AM

    Thanks for posting this. I recently signed up to be a monthly letter writer at moreloveletters.com. I believe it is a great ministry! I only hope the letters I write can encourage others, giving them some inspiration and motivation.

    
131 Erin November 8, 2012 at 9:24 AM

    Love this idea. And what about starting with the ones we are close to whom we might overlook or assume that they know how much they are loved by us or God ? It takes vulnerability to lay it out there, but I need to work on really building up those right beside me.

    
132 Stephanie A November 8, 2012 at 9:24 AM

    Great idea! I’m one of those smashing ladies who does all the encouraging but deep down inside needs a lot of encouragement for my chapter of life I find myself in right now.

    
133 Erin November 8, 2012 at 10:44 AM

    Wow — so true!! I’ve bookmarked the site….such a simple act with so much power.

    
134 Beth B November 8, 2012 at 10:52 AM

    This is just AWESOME! I am so inspired :)

    
135 Theresa Payne November 8, 2012 at 11:34 AM

    Wow! I’m excited to begin my letter writing!!! :O) Thank you.

    
136 Katherine November 8, 2012 at 1:07 PM

    I love, love, LOVE this idea!!! I used to write letters feverishly when I was a teenager & in college…I loved it & it brought such joy. Somehow, I always want to write letters, but rarely do. I don’t know why that is, but am inspired to be more intentional in doing so now.

    I have discovered, after serving as a missionary in China over 3 years & receiving 4 pieces of real mail during that time period…how much each one of those letters means to me!!! There is truly nothing like a hand-written letter which you can read over & over again. What a blessing!!

    I also love the idea of journaling with your children. That is really special :)

    
137 Sarah November 8, 2012 at 1:25 PM

    Wow! How did your daughter find this site? I LOVE this idea and can’t wait to write some letters. I want to offer this to the girls in my Sunday School as well (they are tweens). I think when we open up ourselves to love on others, we are able to see how God loves us and the beauty he sees in us, ultimately lifting our spirits. Never thought about how the next generation has been so connected by electronics how much more grand a handwritten letter is to them.

    Thank you so much for sharing this – the timing couldn’t be better as I’ve been having an “I feel invisible” few days.
