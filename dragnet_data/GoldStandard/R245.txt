Miami Connection’s For Your Consideration trailer requires some serious considering

As you may have already learned via Uproxx email, FilmDrunk is co-presenting a series of screenings of Drafthouse Film’s Miami Connection as it karate kicks its way across the country, and it’s for this reason we were able to procure this exclusive For Your Consideration trailer. In case you don’t know, Miami Connection began as a rare 35 mm print of an obscure, 1987 film release bought for $50 on ebay, which was eventually rediscovered by Drafthouse Films and edited by Hobo with a Shotgun‘s Jason Eisner. It tells the story of 9th degree blackbelt YK Kim, leading his gang of synth-pop martial arts band Dragon Sound against drug-dealing motorcycle ninjas on the streets of Orlando. If that description doesn’t sound awesome to you, we probably can’t be friends.

This latest trailer is aimed specifically at the Academy voter, who’d be wise not to forget the name Maurice Smith when Best Actor nominating time comes around. I just like the whole scene that’s going on around him. Everyone’s either sleeveless or shirtless, there’s a picture of a rock star on the wall, one guy’s crying about a picture of his dead father – it’s like an Uproxx meeting with better haircuts.

Christ, that’s funny. Exponentially funny. One of the funniest things, I’d say.

Having grown up in Florida in the 90s I can tell you that this movie is 100% accurate.

Why does FilmDrunk hate Kansas City (besides the Chiefs, obviously)?
