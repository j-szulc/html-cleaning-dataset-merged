Ilinois-based Rad Rides by Troy built the 1932 Ford Salt Flat racer pedal car by drawing inspiration from Rad Rides by Troy’s successes at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. And, the iconic 1932 Ford roadster is modeled after a salt flat race car which is under construction at their facility. To get this pedal-car closer to the ground, one-off suspension components were created, which then combined with the roll cage and Moon disc-style wheels, giving the car an unmistakable Bonneville look.

In the past in an honor of the 75th anniversary of iconic ’32 Ford, Edsel Ford II sponsored the "Hot Rod Heroes" program, which was a charity event to highlight the creation of 10 custom, one-of-a-kind version of the '32 Ford Roadster Pedal Car. These cars were designed and built by 10 of the leading hot rod designers, and were then auctioned.
