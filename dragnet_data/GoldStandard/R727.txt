IN ST. GERMAIN – PARIS

I am totally inspired by Miu Miu’s FW12 collection, my all time favorite. The shirt and tie are vintage, corderoy jeans by J Brand, Mulberry bag and shoes by Charlotte Olympia.

    This is AMAZING!!! You have totally captured the spirit of that collection. I really love the cord/velvet jeans – the deep blue colour with the mixed purple print of the shirt and tie. The shoes are a perfect cheery on the top. So inspired! X

    the tie and shirt are my two favorite parts of the look. shocked they are vintage they truly go hand in hand with the miu miu collection. the shades of purple truly look wonderful on you.

    Ties are definitely on my radar at the moment, it makes a simple button up look so much more chic. I also love how you clashed both of the prints, great outfit :)
