Amusement Park Owner Hires Squire Sanders to Lobby on OSHA Regulations

The lobbying arm of Squire Sanders is advocating for the owner of the amusement parks Kings Dominion in Virginia and Cedar Point in Ohio, the shop told Congress on Monday.

Squire Sanders Public Advocacy is lobbying for Sandusky, Ohio-based Cedar Fair Entertainment Co. on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations related to fall protection, according to lobbying registration paperwork submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives. The filing, however, doesn't elaborate on the firm's activities concerning the OSHA regulations.

Neither a Cedar Fair representative nor Squire Sanders of counsel Brian Woolfolk, who is handing the account, was immediately available for comment.
In addition to Kings Dominion and Cedar Point, Cedar Fair owns nine other amusement parks, seven water parks and five hotels in the United States and Canada. The company hasn't had a federal lobbyist before, according to congressional records that date to 1999.
