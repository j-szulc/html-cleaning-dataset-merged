The Marketing Power of the Written Word

Copywriter – the mere word springs to mind an image of an unsociable creature left scribbling away in the corner, a field of office-snacks littering the desk and people hurrying past should the said beast awaken and attempt a ‘conversation’. While verbal communication and social interaction is not something typically associated with a writer, there is an air of genius (often mistook for insanity) surrounding a copywriter, for they can manipulate the power of the written word; but how does this help a business?
Oh How Little You Know…

A word, a single indiscriminate work can strike up a mixture of emotion. This misunderstood art is often overlooked, but it is one that has been awkwardly pushed into centre stage in the world of marketing. If you didn’t already know – copywriters and marketing walk hand in hand, generating sales and developing a compelling marketing campaign that invites the consumer into its well-crafted world.

While they can generate a medley of offline and online marketing, we’re going to explore online marketing – from inviting titles to tantalising tag lines and SEO campaigns. The range of content which a copywriter can produce is startling, and the effect it can have on a marketing campaign is dramatic.
Content Marketing – What You Need to Know

A copywriter can produce a wide variety of content for a medley of different mediums; from SEO articles to witty guest blogs and website text, a copywriter can do it all. Used in conjunction with keywords and a well-crafted SEO campaign content marketing could push a website into position one of page one on Google. This in itself is a draw for many businesses – but content can do so much more than get you to the top of Google.

A carefully crafted article could lead to conversions; it also builds a voice for the brand and invites people to trust the business. Did you not realise that content could do this? If not, you probably didn’t realise that it is a powerful tool for marketers and one that many businesses are utilising to their advantage.
