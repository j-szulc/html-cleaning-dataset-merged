NFL says Bears handled Cutler's concussion properly



01:06 PM ET 11.12  On Sunday, Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler took a huge hit from Houston Texans linebacker Tim Dobbins, but he stayed in the game and finished out the quarter before being ruled out for the final two quarters at halftime. According to the Sun Times, the NFL has said that the Bears handled what is now confirmed as a concussion the proper way. "Our office reviewed it with the [Bears] medical staff and it was properly handled," said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello. "The team followed the correct protocol." It's standard practice for the league to review how a team handled any significant injury, especially concussions. It's unclear if the concussion actually occurred on the huge hit, it just seems to be the most likely of suspects. This could mean that Cutler wasn't showing any signs of a concussion from the hit until halftime, or it could mean that he was injured on a later play that wasn't quite as highlight-worthy.

A late illegal hit which was well after the ball was released and worthy of a suspension. 15 yard penalties & petty fines do not adequately discourage lineman from lowering their heads AFTER the play is made. Dobbin's should sit out next week's game with Cutler, hand in hand

That would be appropriate, as the Bears play in San Francisco next week.

Appropriate why? Because it will be a Monday Night Game of two backup quarterbacks?

LOL. True, I missed it, but it still very well may be a Monday Night debacle of two backup QB's. Not exactly what the schedule makers had in mind

Crosses the line of scrimmage and the defender is coming for him..then at the lat second throws the ball down field illegally...POW! He gets it in the kisser! Next time Cutler should be aware of where the line of scrimmage is and if he runs past it; either slide or take the punishment. A few plays later he runs again and dives head first...takes another shot. No wonder he got a concussion. Not a smart player; doesn't realize his importance to his team or their season.

Sounds like yours is the highly ignorant comment. He was barely at the line of scrimmage at the time it happened and he had already thrown the ball downfield. This does not allow a lineman to lower his helmet and charge for a hit after the fact. Pull your finger out of your nose junior.
