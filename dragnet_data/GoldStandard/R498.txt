Posluszny agrees with owner that Jaguars start is embarrassing

Jacksonville Jaguars linebacker Paul Posluszny dropped by “NFL AM” on Wednesday morning to talk about the upcoming matchup with the Indianapolis Colts on NFL Network’s  ”Thursday Night Football. ” He discussed what the defense will face in rookie quarterback Andrew Luck and the team’s start to the season.

Posluszny agreed with owner Shad Khan’s assessment earlier this week that the Jags’ 1-7 start is embarrassing.

“It’s hard to argue with him,” he said. “We did not play well and our record is really, really bad at this point. I mean we’re not playing good football right now. The owner saw things as they are. That is reality. We don’t feel our record really represents us as a team. We feel like we can be a lot better and that we will be in the future, but right now that’s what it is. So we just got to continue to work and try to improve that.”
