Police make arrests in kidnapping of Hulk's sister

SAO PAULO (AP) -- Brazilian police say three people have been arrested for their alleged participation in the kidnapping of the sister of Brazil striker Hulk.

Angelica Aparecida Vieira was released unhurt on Tuesday, a day after being abducted in front of the restaurant where she worked as a nutritionist. Police say on Wednesday that her boss was among those taken into custody, and a candidate for the local city council is being sought in connection with the crime.

Police say the 22-year-old Vieira was released after some of the suspected kidnappers got into a disagreement about the ransom amount. One decided to let her go.
