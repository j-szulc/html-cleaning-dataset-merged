Facebook Adds Photo Filters To iOS Mobile App

The battle of the mobile photo filter apps is under way! Yesterday it was revealed that Twitter was secretly working on an Instagram competitor and now Facebook has launched a filter program of its own.

Fresh off the heels of its Instagram acquisition the worldâ€™s largest social media network has delivered photo filters for Facebook mobile users.

The new iOS update adds Instagram-style filters to Facebook photos as users choose to use them. Pictures uploaded to an Apple-powered device are automatically eligible to use the filters.

To use the program users simple choose a photo to upload and then tap the wand icon. 13 different filters are include, among them are: contrast, cool, coffee, neon, b&w. and more.

After choosing the filter to use the photo can simple be uploaded directly to Facebook.

Since purchasing Instagram Facebook has watched that platform grow to nearly 100 million users. Instagram has also become a news reporting tool of sorts, sending instant updates from various events including Presidential Rallies, the recent San Francisco Giants riots and most notably Hurricane Sandy.

It is unclear at this time how much the new Facebook photo filters will effect the popularity of Instagram. Apparently Facebook wants to be the premium source for mobile photo filtering.
