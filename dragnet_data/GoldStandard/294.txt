F-Secure Report: Another SCADA Attack in Iran â€” This Time With AC/DC 253
Posted by timothy on Tuesday July 24, @10:46AM
from the either-true-or-a-funny-movie-plot dept.
An anonymous reader writes "F-Secure antivirus company of Finland has reported receiving e-mails from an Iranian nuclear scientist, who says Persian uranium-235 isotope refining efforts have just been hit with yet another cyber strike. (Stuxnet, Duqu and Flamer-Skywiper being the previous iterations of the same Operation Project Olympic attack plan.) Last month, President Obama's staff has admitted to the New York Times that there is a joint Israel-U.S. cybermilitary operation was behind the mishaps Iranians have recently been suffering with their UF6 gas refining centrifuge systems in the Natanz and Fordo plants. This time, the unverified e-mail claims, a new Metasploit-based malware owns Iranian VPNs, causes fault in the nuclear plants' Siemens-based industrial control systems, and randomly starts to play AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck' aloud via the infected computers' speakers."

                These "cyber attacks" are criminal activity by the AmeriCIA/Israel government confab - directed against the LEGAL and compliant activity by a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty.

                Israel is NOT signatory - and actually DOES produce weapons, in violation of international law.

                So does India an NPT violator.

                Who will stop these rogue regimes, that pursue their agenda, not through binding treaty obligations or courts of justice, but through rampant sabotage and a program of civilian assassinations?

                    You forgot Pakistan and China in that ramble. You also forgot that the states who did sign the treaty and agreed to be bound by it, the same states who benefited from the signing of the treaties, only one is openly hostile towards another nation. Of course India and Pakistan are or was openly hostile to each other but they didn't sign.

                    Also, international law is not some imposing legal system that strips the sovereignty of nations just because a few states get together and declare something. Imagine if they got together and outlawed the Muslim religions or sodomy by declaration or something.

                    The states in question by your comment have to agree to be bound by the treaty creating the international law or defeated by force and subjected to the ramifications of it ex postfacto. Should one of these non bound countries become openly hostile against another country or threaten the use of Nuclear or Chemical and/or biological weapons, I'm sure the focus of the world will change a bit. Until then, crying that they aren't being troubled is a bit like saying, why am I being arrested for robbing the bank, banks get robbed all the time and those people don't get caught.

        And they should have gone with The Clash, not AC/DC this time... while the song Rock the Casbah was actually about a situation in Afghanistan, the situation in Iran today is very similar to the circumstances in Afghanistan that led to that song being written in the first place. :)

                    Uh no, you get anti-war songs used as title music for the Viet Nam War because that war is almost universally hated, despised, and regretted. When you play a game about that war you know what the outcome is and you know it won't be happy. Irony, it's not just for breakfast any more, but it is for your comment.

                    Had the hook been the main message the song would never have been played. How would that have served any purpose?

                    The idea was to get the song on every radio station, and sell records (and make money). It worked.

                    Once out there, people listen more closely, and when they do the message won't be misunderstood. That you still see it used today, inappropriately simply indicated people new to the song haven't yet listened to much beyond the hook. These are useful idiots, serving the song writer's purpose.

        Someone probably should have explained this to Reagan as he wanted to use it for his campaign song in 1984. Maybe someone should have looked at the lyrics, and not just the title? Needless to say Springsteen did not allow his song to be used by Reagan.

                Indeed. And to get a context for what a singer is all about, looking at more than one of their songs, you would probably want to look at lyrics, you know, the plural of lyric? If I were a politician wanting to endorse a particular artist, I would want to look at more than just the words to a single song.

        A song chronicling the disillusionment of Vietnam veterans is probably not what the people who wrote that code are going for.

        (Of course, a lot of people, including some politicians, seem to think that it's a pro-government patriotic song. Patriotic, maybe, but I'm guessing they never listened to anything but the chorus. Or perhaps the title.)

        I'd like to think that 'Born in the USA' is considered patriotic because people are idiots; but I can never quite shake the nagging feeling that some of its proponents understand, and approve of, its celebration of America as a country where you can cynically throw away the human resources when they are no longer useful...

            The other side thinks it already is, and doesn't want to change a single thing - only roll back some of the changes the first group has already managed.

            I'd prefer to think that "Born in the USA" was cast in the first mold, because recognition is the first step toward fixing. Also, any citizen of any nation can take the first view, and probably should. But then I just might be a little

This somehow seems like a disinformation campaign by the iranians. With the refinement Flame/Stuxnet had, it seems a bit too amateurish that all of a sudden the attack methods would become so much more primitive and obvious to the victims (I mean, seriously, playing loud music in the middle of the night?)

    Given that it is already de-facto-proven-even-for-official-purposes that the US has no qualms about fucking with Iran's computer systems, what would Iran have to gain by some sort of false-flag style thing?

    If there were actually some lingering doubt about the US's willingness, I could see trying to score some points; but there really isn't. The explanations that it was either an attack pulled off by a much less sophisticated actor(hacking isn't totally newb stuff; but the list of people who can make trouble
        
        by deKernel (65640)

        There is nothing tangible to gain in the sense that it helps prove one particular country was the source of the attack. What they are doing is causing doubts as to the progress, if any, in their program. Translation: we are talking mind games with analysis as to just where they stand in the development cycle. Plus, the people within the Iranian program can use this to cover their butts if they are running behind or have something worse happen like explosions at plants and such.

    More likely some poor bastard on the night shift was intentionally and willfully listening to evil mp3s he downloaded from the great satan over livewire, and when he got caught doing air guitar instead of whatever the hell a centrifuge operator does in his spare time, rather than taking the fall for it, commited yet another sin by blaming the CIA.

    The disinfo part is I've worked in industrial plants on networks, and later for decades in companies with airgapped production and IT networks, and the first thing you do after the first infection is airgap IT and everything else you can away from production, then you disassemble production.

    So the scales of upper management weigh:
    1) On one side the ops when they're bored want to check  , email, and play angry birds online
    2) On the other side the plant might be destroyed in an explosion that kills us all and the dictator will kill my family as punishment even though I'm already dead.

    Yeah I can see how the local equivalent of mahogany row decided to leave plant equipment accessible. Yeah, totally realistic. Not PR BS at all. Uh huh.

I have a few bones to pick with the summary, of a factual nature. Corrections are in bold, I have not corrected the grammatical errors.

"F-Secure antivirus company of Finland has reported receiving e-mails from an Iranian nuclear scientist, who says Persian uranium-235 isotope refining efforts have just been hit with yet another cyber strike. (Stuxnet, Duqu and Flamer-Skywiper allegedly being the previous iterations of the same Operation Project Olympic attack plan.) Last month, an anonymous member of President Obama's staff has allegedly admitted to the New York Times that there is a joint Israel-U.S. cybermilitary operation was behind the mishaps Iranians have recently been suffering with their UF6 gas refining centrifuge systems in the Natanz and Fordo plants. This time, the unverified e-mail claims, a new Metasploit-based malware owns iranian VPNs, causes fault in the nuclear plants' Siemens-based industrial control systems, and randomly starts to play AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck' aloud via the infected computers' speakers."

I'm not saying the Times is wrong, but I don't trust their source completely. I also am not claiming he's wrong, but the press has a very bad habit of really fucking up critical details of technology-related stories. For example, I find it pretty hard to swallow that such an operation would only involve the US and Israel. It's all very convenient, and tidy, and in real life the real story is very rarely wrapped up in such a pretty little package. We certainly need at least an independent confirmation of the source's information.

They are seriously dancing around if this is an act of war. If Iran started hitting the US I suspect these actions would have a different spin. Of course the US is a super power so war with them is on a completely different level than the smaller countries.

It's been opened.

The US will not encounter foreign boots on the ground but cyber retaliation... and I promise it could get very ugly. As a former Network Admin, Accelerator Designer, and now Siemens Programmer I can tell you that these viruses can be turned back on us. Much of the world runs on Siemens programming. Oil rigs, chemical mixers, MRI scanners, food prep, power grids, water treatment, and manufacturing assembly of all kinds (right off the top of my head) all run on Siemens hardware/software and we don't have the ability to defend against it.

However, I am not worried about Iran. It's China who already has their digital boots on the ground.

        I've just got to imagine that when the German executives meet with the American sales team, to discuss market penetration of Siemens into new openings, that the American contingent spends most of their energy trying not to giggle.

    This makes me very scared.
    Most of my experience is with Siemens Health Care Solutions. The fact that the world is running on Siemens makes me scared, outside the viruses. Just the POS quality Siemens puts out. I don't know how you people can sleep at night.

> President Obama's staff has admitted to the New York Times that there is a joint Israel-U.S. cybermilitary operation was behind the mishaps Iranians have recently been suffering with their UF6 gas refining centrifuge systems in the Natanz and Fordo plants.

Remind me, when and where exactly did Obama's staff admit this? Is there anything at all besides one article with unsourced allegations?

No doubt the U.S. is behind behind this. But I'm getting damned tired of the shoddy journalism. I've seen so many c

        Besides. The obvious culprit here is Israel. They have the talent and motivation.

        The US is just a spectator by comparison.

        That's supposed to be some kind of joke, right? Israel wouldn't even still be there if not for our support, for good or ill.

In five years time, Iran will have the best SCADA cyber security engineers in the world. I bet they will give this full priority. And when they have these skills, they have the skills to attack as well. Then think of what will happen. The US should better be sure that they are able to *destroy* those machines, so Iran cannot use them to test, otherwise... And how about Germany and Italy - are they still delivering systems to Iran? I wouldn't be surprised!

If it is true, it's bad news:

Assuming that the Stuxnet/Flame attackers are trying to avoid being detected and are not announcing their presence with cheap pranks, the report, if true, would mean someone else has broken into Iranian nuclear weapons research systems, and that it's someone so unprofessional and unskilled that they are doing it as a prank.

Those systems may contain data that nuclear proliferators would love. If they are that insecure, then everything the Iranians have learned could spread rapidl

by Zamphatta (1760346)
This reminds me of April 1st. I highly doubt anyone using malware to slow down or halt the Iranians nuclear efforts, would do it in a way that makes them clearly realize they're infected with something. That's more of a newbie prank or a troll ("unverified email" should keep this story from being news), than a real attempt to stop anything. The whole reason Stuxnext & Duqu were so successful is because of their ninja-like quietness in the systems.

from the RIAA over the money due each time this virus strikes, I mean sheesh, that could amount to a lot of cash right? And the recording industry is hurting what with the trillions of dollars they say they are losing every year to piracy.
Or maybe thats the idea, they will sic the RIAA on the Iranians and save the US military the effort :P

    Hey government, so it's illegal when I share Thunderstruck with my friends, but it's OK for you to spend my tax dollars giving it away to douchebag weapons scientists who don't even like AC/DC? Whatever!

    There's a pretty good analogy with automatic weapons in that I'm not allowed to "permanent loan" a buddy something shiny and fun without the tax stamp and going thru a FFL dealer, but foreign aid regularly delivers weapons to foreigners for free, even if the locals don't like the dictators thugs to be better armed. Its not all that unusual of a situation.

    Actually, playing the music, and calling attention to the exploit is a sign of kiddies at play, and nothing to do
    with any professional or state backed efforts. Why would you reveal your exploit?

    Its possible this is a diversionary tactic to hide something serious going on at different workstations. But I doubt it.
    It could also be an inside prank, because unless you are there to see the panic ensue, why play music. But I doubt that as well.

    The story is just as likely to be totally bogus: Unverified email form a nuclear scientist, Really!?, Like these guys get to send mail unguarded, un-scanned, un-censored?
