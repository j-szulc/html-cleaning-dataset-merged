Free Online Cryptography Course

Dan Boneh of Stanford University is offering a free online cryptography course. The course runs for six weeks, and has five to seven hours of coursework per week. It just started last week.

Recommended! I just completed this course a few weeks ago (they must run several of them in a row).

It's very good - at least as good as the cryptography I studied in my masters degree. A nice focus on security proofs, alongside practical implementation considerations.

There is also a Cryptography II course starting next January/February which looks at more advanced public key crypto stuff that wasn't covered in the first one.

Also recommended. I took the course on its first offering (I believe the current one is the 3rd or 4th). Unfortunately, family drama prevented me from having time to complete it, but I do plan to dig into it again. Lots of fun and a good knowledge builder.

Taking it right now. Finally thankful for the advanced math that my CS degree required. Other than the math proofs and notation, he is pretty easy to follow.

"The course will include written homeworks and programming labs."
What programming language?

Re: Which programming language, I think it's agnostic, the first gives you some strings and tells you to come back with a decryption.

Just FYI, a group of members of the faculty at the Computer Science College at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid maintain an "Information Security Encyclopedia" at the following address:

It is (mostly) in Spanish and now counts with 14 videos devoted to a wide variety of topics.

Jan,

programming seemed to be generally in Python, but you could use whatever you wanted. As N said, the programming was used to find an answer - you did not submit the code itself.

 Matt Palmer at November 13, 2012 9:33 AM

Oh - and the programming assignments were entirely optional. You got extra credits for doing them. I didn't bother as I had little time available for the course, although I generally read through them to understand what was being asked. I still passed the course without doing them.

I highly recommend exploring all of the courses which Coursera has to offer.

I recently took Charles Severance's "Internet History, Technology, and Security" and absolutely loved it.
