Preview of my keynote at upcoming WOMMA Summit

I'm a long-time supporter of the Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA). It is the premier community of marketers focused on word of mouth marketing. I was on the very first board back in 2006.I an honored to be doing a keynote for their annual Summit again. Here's a preview of my talk which is based on my upcoming book, Monster Business: Loyalty Lessons from Lady Gaga. Hope to see you there!
