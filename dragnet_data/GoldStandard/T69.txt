Romney Vs. Obama On Investment

This should speak volumes.


Mitt Romney created jobs and made money. If you had given him $1000 to invest when he started Bain and left it in his hands, you would be a millionaire dozens of times over -- and it would be your money to do with as you choose.

Barack Obama lost nearly every dime of your tax dollars -- but it doesn't matter to him, because he has no skin in the game and no accountability (other than at the ballot box). And even if his investments of your money had been wildly successful, you would not have seen a penny of the profits -- but the same "green energy" hucksters who got money from Obama are injecting green back into his campaign, but not the US Treasury.

Now remind me again why we should leave failed president Barack Obama in charge of the economy, rather than giving successful businessman Mitt Romney the nod in November.
