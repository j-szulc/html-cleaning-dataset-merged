Upcoming Learn with Google Hangout: Holiday Bidding Strategies on Google Shopping

Thursday, October 25, 2012 | 11:36 AM

Entering the busy holiday season, we all need a little help. That’s why we’re shimmying down the chimney with a bag full of goodies to make the web work for your business.

What you used to know as Product Search in the U.S. has just transitioned to a new commercial experience, based on Product Listing Ads, called "Google Shopping." We’re making it easier for retailers of all sizes to compete and acquire customers more efficiently.

In this session you'll hear about best practices for succeeding in the new Google Shopping experience. We'll cover campaign structure and bidding strategies -- from simple to advanced -- with a special focus on holiday products and promotions. We'll also share retailer success stories. And, we'll take a quick look at upcoming features.

Break out the hot cocoa and join us this Monday, October 29th (10am PT/1pm ET) for a Hangout on Air with Jon Venverloh, Head of Platforms for Google Shopping. Visit the Learn with Google page to register and see our whole series.

We look forward to seeing you there!
