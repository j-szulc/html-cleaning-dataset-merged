30 Days of Secret Giveaways! Day 3

November 12, 2012 by Nicolette  


Because we have been so blessed by YOU our readers, we can’t help but give back.  This means Santa’s coming a little early this year!  Have you been good?  We hope so, because our elves have been tinkering on some amazing prizes to give away.  But this is no regular giveaway.

There will be not one, not two, but THIRTY prizes!  Yes, that means 30 days of giveaways!

The catch?  These are FLASH giveaways and will only last a few short hours and can be posted randomly at anytime during the day.  So KEEP CHECKING the site and become our BFF on Facebook so you can be the first to enter.

Of course we have to have some fun in the process, so the prize will be a SECRET until you click on the link below and correctly answer the top secret question.

Are you the touchy-feely type?  Well, get a little closer with  TODAY’S SECRET PRIZE.  Someone on you gift list is dying to get his hands on this!

Are you ready to enter?  Thought so.  It’s super easy; first, check out TODAY’S SECRET PRIZE.  Then come back and answer today’s secret question.

ANSWER THE SECRET QUESTION IN THE RAFFLECOPTER GIVEAWAY LINK BELOW (please do not answer in the comments section):

With this product, what should be a pleasure, not a chore ? (Don’t worry, the answer is G-rated and found in the product description.)


And lastly, do a good deed, send happy thoughts into the universe, and let Karma work her magic!

Good luck and see you again tomorrow. It’s a good one!

Congratulations to our winners:

Day 1: Thresia, AL

Day 2: Annette Y.
