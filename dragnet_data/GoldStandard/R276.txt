Today's Recipe: Today's Recipe: Apple-Date Betty
Posted by Danielle Black

This dessert is as American as apple betty. No, we don't mean pie. Brown betties have been around since colonial times, with good reason. They're so much easier to make than pie. No finicky crust. No rolling. Instead, buttery toasted bread stands in, but you still get that fabulous spiced-apple flavor that you would from a pie.
