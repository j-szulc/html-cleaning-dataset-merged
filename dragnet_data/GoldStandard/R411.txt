PLYMOUTH, Mich. - Matt Mahalak made 36 saves to lead the Plymouth Whalers to a 4-1 victory over the Saginaw Spirit in Ontario Hockey League action Tuesday.

The game was held in the afternoon as many area schools were off due to the U.S. election.

Ottawa Senators' prospect Stefan Noesen scored a pair of goals for the Whalers (9-5-3), including the game's first and last goals.

After Noesen opened the scoring at 7:50 of the first period, Garret Ross answered for Saginaw (6-10-2) just 16 seconds later on the ensuing shift.

That would be the closest the Spirit would get as Anaheim Ducks' draft pick Rickard Rakell scored at the end of the first period for Plymouth.

Matt Mistele and Noesen added goals in the third period for the Whalers, who pulled into a first-place tie with Sarnia in the West Division.

Rakell added two assists for Plymouth, which held the Spirit to 0-for-6 on the power play.

Detroit Red Wings' prospect Jake Paterson finished with 35 saves for Saginaw.
