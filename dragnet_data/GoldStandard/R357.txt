New Delhi: BJP leader Ram Jethmalani on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on his party president Nitin Gadkari and also targeted Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi. The mercurial lawyer demanded Gadkari's resignation, saying that the move will save the party's image and called Rahul Gandhi an "illiterate".

"He should resign or it will damage the party's image. If he takes time it will damage the partyâ€™s image. He should resign in the interest of the party and the country," said Jethmalani about Gadkari. Jethmalani said that he had tried to raise the issue at the party forum but no one paid any attention. "I had written to Gadkari for a meeting, but no meeting has taken place," Jethmalani said.

Attacking Gadkari over his comparison of Swami Vivekananda with the absconding underworld don-turned-terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, Jethmalani said, "I think it is a very silly statement on Gadkari's part. Frankly, I would have resigned... but the country needs opposition party. I am facing tremendous conflict in my mind 

Asked at a press conference about Rahul Gandhi, Jethmalani said the Congress is trying to force him on India as the future prime minister, but he (Rahul) does not even know the difference between Kargil and FDI. Jethmalani said that he has made no secret of the fact that he considers Rahul Gandhi to be an "illiterate".
