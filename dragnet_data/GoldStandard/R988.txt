    Congratulations! I’ve been reading for quite a while and I’m interested in hearing how this shifts your work-life balance. I have a 14 month old who was born as I was finishing my PhD and a newborn and I can say it really makes you prioritize!

    Congratulations on “Your New Project!” You and your wife will have lots of fun and happiness “hacking” this particular project. BTW, I’ve read two of your book and loved them. I read: 1. So Good They Can’t Ignore You,” and “How to be a Straight A Student.” The other day, I sent my smartie son one of your (guest) posts on learning Linear Algebra quickly. Thanks so much for all you do…and again, CONGRATULATIONS!
