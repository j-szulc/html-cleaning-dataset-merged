#3 (and a few other stuffs)
By Lim Cheng Soon, 31 July 2010
Issue #3 finally got out the door, probably the hardest Ricky and myself ever worked. Make sure you check out the Tech Jobs section and the Operational Transformation article by Daniel Spiewak (it's really cool). Now that it's on print (if you didn't order the print, you can always download the PDF and print it out), you no longer have the 'tl;dr' excuse.

Print subscription is coming. It will be big for the readers outside US, UK and Canada. because I'm working (around the margins) to cut down the international shipping cost (which currently sets at a hefty $13.45 flat rate in MagCloud) for annual subscribers. I really wanted more people to experience the print edition. 

It's a thing of beauty.
