Unilever, DHL Partner to Drive Sustainability, Efficiency


Unilever and DHL Supply Chain have partnered on a series of initiatives that the companies say will increase sustainable practices and the speed of bringing products to market.

According to Unilever and DHL, these new initiatives include developing technology to improve carbon efficiency and reduce waste within global logistics operations. The companies don’t, however, provide details.

Unilever and DHL also say they plan to extend the geographical footprint of existing services, particularly in developing and emerging markets including Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico.

Other activities include a “design once, deploy everywhere” methodology to identify and use new and innovative processes across Unilever’s supply chain.

The agreement is a step toward Unilever’s goal to halve its environmental impact while doubling its size, according to the consumer goods company, whose global brands include Dove, Omo, Knorr and Lipton.

This joint business development plan is part of Unilever’s Partner to Win program to work more closely with its suppliers. It also supports both companies’ carbon-reduction initiatives: Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan, which include more than 50 social, economic and environmental targets such as its goal to reduce by 50 percent the company’s greenhouse gas emissions, water and waste used by the company in its direct operations; and DHL’s GoGreen initiative, a carbon-neutral shipping option for DHL and Deutsche Post customers.

In March, Unilever launched an online platform seeking technical solutions for reducing its environmental impact.

The company has also committed to sustainably sourcing 100 percent of its paper and board packaging by 2020.
