• Use most 3D programs like 3D max, C4D & even Element 3D

Could someone please answer this! I have bought all of video copilot's products so far and i am still learning as much as i can. I am now stepping in 3D as well and would like to know the following before i buy element 3D too. I understand some of its functionalities like particle replicator, animating 3D models etc. But apart from importing those 3D files made with other programs, can element 3D itself create basic 3D stuff from scratch, for example the rocks in the tutorial above? Or the 3D debris material from the meteor crash tutorial? Referencing the epic shatter tutorial, can element 3D shatter that same 3D ball? Anyways keep up the good job guys! I hope we can see a 3D package with some form of vehicles like a car and a chopper sometime as well. Will definitely buy that and also looking forward to 3D buildings and skyscrapers pack!

Hey Andrew,
Great content! One more thing that separates VCP from the others. Hey, are you responsible for the titles on the new show "Revolution", it just really reminds me of something you would do.
Cheers

Great tutorial! At first I was like "Hmm, this doesn't seem so "cool" as all the other tutorials" but I take it all back... :) The epiphany came to me last night when I watched Avatar. And in one of the earlier scenes, you see a tower on pandora with a man walking around in it. Now, I'm quite sure the tower is 3D, and I wondered how it was possible to put a piece of (I assume) green screen footage WITHIN that 3D tower, so the footage is not just in front of the tower, or behind it... Well now I know ;) Thanks Andrew!

Very, very cool tutorial.

I thought I knew about Z passes, but it turns out I knew nothing! I use them to mess around with focus, nothing like as cool an application as this.

Real behind the scenes of Motion picture effects stuff, thank you \^^/

Wow. That is infinitely helpful. Never even thought of that haha!

Dominic

Only apply the zdepth in a lens camera blur effect mask option, and that's it!

Does blender have the ability to render out a Z-pass?

09/06/2012
Yes. Every 3d program has it.
Even some engineering programs.
