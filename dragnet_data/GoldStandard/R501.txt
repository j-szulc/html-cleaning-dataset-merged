Monday Nightmare: LeSean McCoy only 40 points short

Well, I knew it was going to be a longshot. I needed about 50 points from LeSean McCoy to overtake Doug Martin‘s 50-point outburst on Matt “Money” Smith‘s team. And while it was wonderful Andy Reid remembered McCoy was on his team (with 19 attempts), he wasn’t quite able to make up the difference.

The brutal part was McCoy did just enough for Money’s team in our other expert’s league to hold off my team there to complete the sweep. So that was fun. There has been only one time where I’ve been able to “shoot the moon” to get enough fantasy points from one player to win a league, and hold off a challenger.

This wasn’t my night.

In these leagues, all you can ask for is to get 100 points to win. I nailed that twice, but lost to the league’s top scorer on both occasions. And to think, I was enjoying comfortable leads before the Buccaneers’ game kicked off on Sunday afternoon.

But does anybody else have a sob story?

Oh boy. So who else has a story? Don’t be shy. Consider this one great big fantasy therapy session, and this is your couch. Let it all out, you’ll feel better when you do.

Oh, and in lieu of my typical signature, I’m going to ask you all to vote. In the real election, and in this fantasy election, too. And no, I didn’t say I wanted to raise league fees. But check it out and #voterank.
