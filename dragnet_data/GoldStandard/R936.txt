Sprint is building out its 4G LTE network little by little, today listing 9 more markets to get LTE treatment.

The areas are:

    Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minn.
    Fort Smith, Ark.
    Ardmore, Okla.
    Oakland/Fremont/Hayward, Calif.
    Eau Claire, Wis.
    Key West, Fla.
    Bloomington, Ind.
    Michigan City/La Porte, Ind.
    McAllen/Edinburg/Mission, Texas

Minnesota's Twin Cities center is the largest of the bunch, with several key traffic areas also accounted for. Speaking from local experience, the San Francisco Bay Area cities of Oakland, Fremont, and Hayward are significant, high-population coverage areas, though Sprint has skipped the much more populous cities of San Francisco and San Jose.

LTE is still some weeks to months off, though customers in those areas may start seeing LTE speeds before the official launch.
