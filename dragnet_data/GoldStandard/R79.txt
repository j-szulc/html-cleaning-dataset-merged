Please share your Twitter details if you’re willing to help other educators

I’ve attended a few workshops recently for educators new to using social media with students.

And it’s made me reflect on what it was like when I started out and what helped.  Online and face-to-face mentors really played a crucial role; they introduced me to new ideas while supporting and encouraging.

Most of us encourage educators to join Twitter as we know how much it helps our own personal learning. Twitter lists of people who are willing to help and mentor others could really help!

We’ve decided the best way to create the Twitter lists is using a Google Form.

And here’s how you can help:

    Can you complete our form if you would like to mentor others?
    Can you share a link to our form with your network? The more responses we receive, the better it helps everyone!

Thanks for helping out!
