One Duck at a Time

Ducks in a Row vs. Ducks in a Bunch. I’ve talked about this before.

For most of us, getting your ducks lined up before you start something can be disabling. It’s like waiting for all the lights to turn green before you leave the house.

While some folks need to move from Ducks in a Row to Ducks in a Bunch to get going, there are many others that need to take things One Duck at a Time.

Maybe that’s you. If you’re having a tough time getting started, stop trying to herd ducks – just attend to one duck at a time.

That’s what we’re doing at Small Biz Tracks – one track at a time.
