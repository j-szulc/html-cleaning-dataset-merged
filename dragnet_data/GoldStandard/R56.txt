You may have noticed that we Portlanders have a tendency to select our music (and clothing palettes) according to the whims of the weather. Now that fall (and the rain) is in full swing around these parts, all I want to do is curl up by a fire.  In that spirit, I present to you the BitchTapes: Fireplace Grooves edition. While listening to this mix, I recommend sitting by a fire and doing at least one of the following: eating bowls of soup, drinking hot cider or cocoa from an oversized mug (let me humbly suggest this one), cuddling with your pet(s), knitting scarves, drinking wine or hot toddies (Please be advised that combining several hot toddies with knitting can only end in disaster. Trust me on this one).
