It’s back! HOT giveaway from Jo Totes!

November 10, 2012 by alysha  


It’s here! I’ve been excited for this giveaway for a long time. It’s going to be a fun one. :) This giveaway was SO popular the last time we ran it, we teamed up with Jo Totes to bring it back!

Have you heard of Jo Totes? If you haven’t it’s about time you do! Their camera bags are so convenient, not to mention they are gorgeous eye candy.  And now, they are giving one away to Y.O.U. Are you ready?!

Tired of your dreary, old, UGLY camera bag? Me too. Luckily Jo Totes has come to the rescue!

Jo Totes has been creating camera bags for women all around the world since 2009.

They started with the goal to provide pretty and fashionable day bags for
women to safely carry their cameras and a lens or two (plus purse items) while out and
about.

 {Swoon.}

Ok, this bag is so trendy and adorable! Totally beats my bulky black one I’ve been lugging around for ages. ;)

All of Jo Totes bags include:
Padding sewn directly into the interior lining, zippered pockets, an adjustable
cross-body strap, and removable pads which are completely customizable!

I love all of the fun compartments you can use for your camera, lens, and other goodies. :)

 I think they could double as a cute purse as well. ;)

It is SO hard to choose a favorite! TRUST ME! Just take a look at all of these lovelies.

 

Giveaway Time!

Jo Totes is giving one HDS reader their very own bag of their choice! Yep!

Just call it a Christmas present to yourself. ;)

Entries: -Leave a separate comment for each one you complete.-

1. (Mandatory.) Visit Jo Totes and let us know which style and color is calling your name.


For additional entries:

2. “Like” Jo Totes on FB. While you’re there, you can ‘like’ HDS as well. ;) We love our friends!

3.  Freebie. Since Thanksgiving is coming up soon, tell us something you are thankful for.

-

Giveaway will end next Saturday, November 17th. Good luck to all of you!
