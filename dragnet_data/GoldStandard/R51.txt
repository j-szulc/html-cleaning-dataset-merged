THE ENTRIES WERE AMAZING
Thank you to all of contestants who entered the bernette by BERNINA "My World" Contest. Contestants were asked share photos of a garment they made in the style that they are inspired to wear. The entries were amazing and the photography revealed their creativity, beautiful detail work, and inspiration.

CONGRATULATIONS TO CYNBULAR!
Congratulations to cynbular who created the Bow Print Dress. In her post she wrote, "I saw this fun bow print cotton lawn at the fabric store and knew I wanted to make a pretty fit and flare style dress." We think she did a great job doing just that! Cynbular will receive BERNINA's Bernette 25 sewing machine. I'm sure it will be a terrific addition to her sewing room.

Thanks again to all who entered the contest.
