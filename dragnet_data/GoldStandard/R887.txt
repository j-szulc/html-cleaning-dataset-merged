Tech Execs Headed to White House for Fiscal Cliff Meeting
 November 12, 2012 by Alex Fitzpatrick

Three technology executives are reportedly among a handful of top business executives headed to the White House for a meeting with Barack Obama on Wednesday.

Tech execs on the list include Ginni Rometty, President, Chairman and CEO of IBM; Ursula Burns, Chairman and CEO of Xerox and David Cote, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell, who will join decision makers from American Express, Walmart, Ford and more. That’s according to a list provided by an “insider” to Politico.

While many in the business community favored Obama’s challenger, Mitt Romney, the full list of attendees includes a bipartisan mix of Republicans and Democrats.

The purpose of the meeting? It’s likely part of Obama’s approach to handling negotiations over the “fiscal cliff,” a perfect storm of tax increases and spending cuts that could potentially prolong or reverse the United States’ economic recovery. Additionally, the Romney campaign often accused Obama of being ineffective at dealing with the business world — this meeting may help dissolve memories of that attack line.

Obama is taking an inside-and-outside-the-Beltway approach to the talks, meeting not only with members of Congress but also with business executives, union leaders and workers in an effort to drum up support for his solution: preserving tax cuts for those making less than $250,000 a year and raising taxes on those who make more along with spending cuts.

Should the meeting include more representatives of the tech community? Share your thoughts in the comments.
