So Alexa Posny, the assistant secretary for special education and rehabilitative services, is leaving the U.S. Department of Education this week. Michael Yudin, who seems to be the department's go-to-acting assistant secretary, will fill in, for now. Much more over at On Special Education.

Could Posny's departure be the first of many over at 400 Maryland Ave.? We're almost at the end of President Barack Obama's first (and maybe only?) term as president. If presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney wins the election, most Obama political appointees will be out of a job come January. Plus, working at the department can't be a cakewalk. (Just try reading one of these.)

Who else will be putting in their resignation this fall? Guesses welcome in the comments section.
