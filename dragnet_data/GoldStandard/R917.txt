    In being an Australian I have heard of Pumpkin Pie, but never actually tried any. I so look forward to this.

    A pie made from fresh, roasted, and scooped-out pumpkin meat and toasted fresh ground spices....Baked on a lovingly hand-made crust? Kick@$$, Chef!!

    Looks amazing. My family always uses 'Lakeshore Pumpkin' pumpkin pur√©e and follow the recipe on the label. It is an awesome Victorian can label with this cool pumpkin illustration, and it is a family classic. Can't wait to try this version.

    Chef John this is off topic of the pie but you always say to use freshly ground black pepper. Where/what would you recommend. I don't want to just buy one from any store and have it be years old.

    Sorry, don't understand the BP question. Just buy black peppercorns and a grinder. All brands of black peppercorns in the store are basically exactly the same.
