Subscription Option Now Available
By Lim Cheng Soon, 18 August 2010

We have finally rolled out the long awaited subscription option.

The 12 Month Print Subscription plan costs $88, includes 12 issues of Hacker Monthly (with 40 - 56 pages & perfect bound), and delivers anywhere in the world (shipping fee costs $2 to $10 per issue depending on your location). There is also 12 Month Digital Subscription plan, costs $29 and delivers the latest Hacker Monthly in digital format (pdf, epub, mobi) to your email for the next 12 months.

As you might notice, we will be charging $3 for the digital version of Hacker Monthly starting from issue #4. The biggest reason we made this move is, if succeed, we will be sustainable, or in other words: we could continue producing high quality Hacker Monthly for a very, very long time. With that, we also could lower the cost of the print magazine, to encourage more readers to get the print version - which is the why we created Hacker Monthly in the first place.
