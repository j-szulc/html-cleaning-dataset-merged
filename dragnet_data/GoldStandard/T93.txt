Why should MG be left behind?

When every other auto company is busy pouring out a new SUV concept from its kettle, why should MG not get an opportunity to participate? Well, it was given a fair opportunity and the British automaker presented its Icon concept SUV. In recent years, MG hasn’t been able to maintain itself in news for any interesting reasons. It has been associated with names like MGA, MGB and Midget, but since a last few years, all it has done is change owners. Especially, when it comes to SUVs, MG has nothing to talk about and with this concept car, it is attempting a new innings.

Considering it as the first ever initiative, let’s go a little light on the auto company, which is now owned by SAIC. Icon looks like kind of a naïve attempt. Rather than making a mark as an SUV, it appears to be a car based crossover. We are basically talking about the design. And anyways, at this point the company is not offering many details on SUV’s technology or mechanical niceties. In fact at this stage, MG people are talking more about their previous successes. Thus, they are putting forth Icon’s design as an inspiration from MGB GT and MGA.

The vehicle is bigger than automaker’s earlier products, but for a crossover, the size could have been bigger. Icon can comfortably accommodate 4 passengers and additionally there are folding rear seats. The car is supposed to be MG’s trophy design, marking 50 years of its existence. Well, the company has steered in a new direction on its 50th anniversary; hope the journey witnesses exciting curves ahead!
