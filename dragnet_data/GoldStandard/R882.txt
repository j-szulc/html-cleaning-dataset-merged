Lexington Avenue Agency

+Quespacio designed a model agency with an urban but sophisticated image in the city of Valencia, Spain.

Project description:

When our client contacted us he explained us he wanted to create a new model agency with the name Lexington Avenue Agency in our city, Valencia, with an urban but sophisticated image.

First of all we created a series of identity images after a large studio of the famous Lexington Avenue from New York. We select the colors black and yellow, very representative for the yellow cabs together with a series of images from the yellow cabs and New York skyscrapers. After the chose from our client for one of our image designs we adapted it to its desires and started to think about the interior design, in which both parts, the client and our studio where surely convinced that it needed to be corporative and different.

Primarily the office needed to be divided in 2 spaces and to be transparent to receive in both spaces the natural light. We choose an industrial curtain combined with a sticker from the identity logo to gave the office a first touch of identity and urban style. In the first room you can see the incorporation of the black and yellow lines from the logo giving it an extra corporative touch. We also choose to reflect the black and yellow lines in the second room but in a less extent to avoid that the project terminated to be overloaded.

In furniture we choose for renamed brands from Spain, but not habitual to use in our country. We opted for furniture from Uno Design by Javier Mariscal and the ecofriendly Eiffel, a recycled paper stool from the pretty new RS Barcelona. This combined with white office furniture and a white floor to create the urban and sophisticated touch.
