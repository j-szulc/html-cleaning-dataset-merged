Diana Butler Bass in 3-D!
August 6, 2012 by Tripp Fuller 2 Comments

A podcast legend visits LA live! Listen in as Bo gets to ask the famed author about her new book Christianity After Religion, why Christianity isn’t a religion, the decline of the Mainline, the Methodist tradition as well as topics ranging from sexuality to other religions.

This event was hosted by a group getting ready to launch new conversation this Fall (visit theLoftLA.org for more) and Diana steps up for the Q&R to take on all comers! She doesn’t flinch at a single question that is thrown her way.

Hi Bo - As always a brilliant podcast :o) I was wondering if the Pete Rollins and DBB session happened and if so is there a recording to be posted? Because on the thread I posed a question which was - what about the church growth in China and India and other parts of the developing world?  (The post seems to have disappeared I gave this link: http://www.christiantoday.co.uk/article/church.in.china.experiencing.tremendous.growth/26420.htm)  I am wondering what if there is anything we can learn from it. Perhaps Diana has mentioned this in her book which I confess I haven't read ....
