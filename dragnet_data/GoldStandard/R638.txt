Color Life

I'm thrilled to share with you my exciting, new collaboration with the colorful crew at Benjamin Moore! It's called Color Life, an interactive magazine for the iPad and Android that invites you to experience color like never before. 

Check out this short video to see the magic in action.

For the latest issue, I decided to refresh and reinvent our entrance foyer in Connecticut with a dazzling dose of color. 

As you can see, it's spacious with plenty of charming architectural details, but I wanted to bring out its character with color. 

To view all of the big, beautiful after shots, simply visit the the iTunes store or click here to download. From paint palettes to features on top designers, Color Life is a fantastic way to get inspired and explore the dazzling world of color from Benjamin Moore. Huge thanks to John Smallwood, Carol Bokuniewicz, and everyone at Benjamin Moore for inviting us to share in such innovative technology. Now what are you waiting for, everyone?

I am very disappointed with this non-article. No after shot--just an advertisement to purchase.

I am very disappointed in you, Eddie. Your loyal fans deserve better.
