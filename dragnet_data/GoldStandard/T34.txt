What Is Marketing?

Let’s face it, to the average business person, marketing equals promotion.

Marketing is what you say and how you say it when you want to explain how awesome your product is and why people should buy it.

Marketing is an ad. Marketing is a brochure. Marketing is a press release. And more recently, Marketing is a Facebook page or a Twitter account.

Marketing, to many business people, is simply selling at a larger scale.

The reality, is that marketing sits at the intersection of the business and the customer – the great arbiter of the self interests of the business and the needs of the buyer. As the global economy settles into a new normal of consistent doubt, Marketing has an identity problem, a brand perception gap, maybe even a crisis of confidence.

“Business has only two functions – marketing and innovation.”  ~ Milan Kundera

When I transitioned out of a successful sales career almost 15 years ago, most of my peers thought I was crazy. The head of our division hung up on me (it wasn’t the first time).

Increasingly, after more and more conversations with real customers, I had bought in to the idea that marketing represented the future. I sold what was “in the sales bag.”

But I wanted to help shape the future. Naive? Probably. Delusional? Certainly. Possible? Definitely!

“The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself.” ~ Peter F. Drucker

Marketing is not about who can talk faster, or close better. It is about deep psychological understanding of customer needs. Steve Jobs had this gift better than almost any example. Henry Ford. Thomas Edison. Every innovation in the history of the world combined an uncanny understanding of human needs and the innovative vision to deliver it.

“Marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department.” ~ David Packard

If business is composed of marketing and innovation, and marketing is about deep customer insights, then marketing is the job of every employee.

“Social media” has only made this point painfully clear: every employee is an extension of the brand. The brand serves to meet the needs of the customer and the business serves to innovate.

Wir Sitzen Alle Im Marketing!

I’m not sure Google translator gave me the right translation but whether you are in finance, or sales, marketing or the owner of a small business, we are all in marketing.

What is Marketing? I did a search on this term to look for some inspiration and found this recent article from Reliving MBA Days that does a great job reviewing the basics of marketing.

    Marketing (to me) is the
    - creation,
    - maintenance, and
    - expansion
    of mutually profitable relationships between ‘supplier’ and ‘customer’.

    The problem with this definition (and most others) is that it does not give room to sales.
    By trying to define what marketing is, we tend to also stress its differences with for example sales, which results in a semantic discussion on definitions and differencens, which does not stimulate/enable the necessary/crucial but very often absent integration of marketing and sales activities.

    Some personal thoughts on the other definitions used:

    It seems Kundera puts all other functions as being inferior/supportive (my words for lack of better) to marketing & innovation. Do owners/shareholders of businesses see it the same way? Why is that so?

    I agree with Drucker but can it be that he is overlooking something? Sometimes (potential) customers do not know (or unable to express even a slight hint) what their need is….

    Totally agree with Packard. Sadly not a lot of marketeers are willing to / capable of ‘admitting’ this.

    The ‘we are all in marketing’ seems a bit too much hype for me. I have yet to find non-marketeers who are inspired/motivated by this statement.

    Michael,

    Thanks for a great post. This is an excellent primer on the value marketing brings. As you mentioned with a backdrop of economic uncertainty, there is a credibility gap found among non marketers. Their view at times,is limited to a small number of marketing produced assets without appreciating the overall contributions of marketing.

    How can marketers change these misconceptions? Your primer does help. Perhaps this can be fodder for a future blog post.

    Hi!, I think Marketing is each and everything that makes you sell MORE.

    I won’t pontificate on what marketing is, you have done that nicely here. I want to add a note on the mindset I believe marketers need.

    “Marketing should serve and respect the audience.”

    For marketing to sit at the intersection of the customer and the business, they can’t keep shouting the company’s message. Instead they need to show a genuine interest in the business’s potential customers and work to make their lives better. Done well, the benefits will come back to them.

    Nice break from your Tuesday/Thursday schedule!

    Thanks Dirk, VERY interesting observations. I don’t disagree with your definition at all. I do think the “marketing and innovation” quote was meant to reference the process of marketing (knowing the customer so well that you have the products they need) and innovation (delivering these solutions better than others could). That is how I read his quote.

    (Disclosure: I love the Drucker quote) I agree with Drucker and thins he really means that you truly know the customer inherently and deeply and that is how you can anticipate needs that customers may not be able to articulate themselves. I think Steve Jobs stated something to this effect at one point.

    And fair point on the “we’re all in marketing” thing. I guess I got carried away! ;-)

    Thanks Irving. Yes, this is just a primer. We should deal with how we close this gap in the future. I have some previous posts on this as well.

    Luis, not sure I agree. Sell more of what? of anything? Marketing needs to also help determine what niche the company can supply uniquely.

    Michael,

    My favorite, from Howard Gossage:

    “People read what interests them, and sometimes it’s an ad.”

    Replace “ad” with “marketing” and you have the definition of “pull”.

    Regards,

    Michael,

    Couldn’t agree more with your post. The Drucker quote is my favorite of the bunch but they are all very good answers. I am not sure how to address the confusion with advertising and promotion but do think it is an issue (and do find it ironic that marketing has awareness problem).

    I also think Seth Godin does a great job answer this question while explaining the difference between marketing and advertising. Check out http://www.thedefinitionofmarketing.com/

    Thanks,

    Hello Michael,

    I enjoyed the article; great quotes and summary!

    Translated back into (literal) German “Wir Sitzen Alle Im Marketing!” means “We are all sitting in Marketing!”. If you want to use this phrase in the future, which I think you should, try “Wir alle sind im Marketing!” instead.

    Great discussion.

    I think of marketing as two simple things, perhaps not so simple. Know your customer so well that you can make yourself attractive to be found by them and then accelerate their buying process for selecting you.

    Attracting customers is about connecting with them based on what they care about. Accelerating their buying is about anticipating their buying process needs and feeding them the right information at the right time in the way they need it.

    The challenge with today’s customer centric marketing is the need to address markets of one. It requires very different thinking and processes.

    Thanks Eric, I agree completely and like that you brought in the notion of respect. I try to teach my kids the same thing about going in the water at the beach. You don’t need to fear it, you don’t need to avoid, you shouldn’t take it for granted. Just respect the power!

    I’m off for vacation tomorrow so thought i would mix it up a bit! Have a great rest of the summer.

    Josh, thanks so much for that link. It is perfect. There is a reason Seth has been able to make a living doing what he does: he answers the big questions in really simple and clear ways.

    I figured the translation was off and was hoping some German-speaking friend would help clarify for all of us. Thank you!

    Thanks Jim, I think you are hitting on one of (maybe) the 2 main themese of this whole blog: focus on customers by delivering great content that helps THEM and the second is the transition to a social-digital business mindset that allows the “interest community” (those aligned by common interests, including the brand employee) to serve itself.

    Perhaps you should expand the definition of marketing to include selecting target markets. A marketer can’t just “know the customer” today. You need to know the customer (or the potential range of customers) of tomorrow, their needs, what alternatives will be available and what competitors will be offering at some point in the future, and what your company can offer at that point. That analysis leads to strategic decisions about who the company will target, what it will offer, how it will reach the target customers (channels), and decisions about pricing, packaging, ongoing support and many other topics.

    This analysis and these decisions may not be as obvious to people on the outside as branding, advertising and communications, but they are strategic and usually are only be performed by marketers (or general managers wearing marketing hats).

    I would argue that in many industries (certainly high technology) targeting, and all of the decisions that flow from that, are more important for justifying the marketing group than branding, communications and lead generation.

    Actually, I see that the linked article on “What is Marketing” at http://relivingmbadays.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/what-is-marketing/ covers most of the points I was making.

    The key idea is that activities like “opportunity identification” and “new product development” (to use the terms in the article) are frequently overlooked and should always be included in a discussions of what marketing brings to the company.

    Thanks Jon,

    I agree. Once I saw their article, I realized they covered these basics so I focused on some other key points.
