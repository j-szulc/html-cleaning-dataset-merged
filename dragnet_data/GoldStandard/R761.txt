Residential Project Inspiring Well-Being and Comfort in San Diego

Inspired by the housing communities from the 1920′s, Jonathan Segal FAIA has unveiled his latest residential masterpiece in San Diego, California. The Charmer (the name given to this project) is a 19-unit multifamily dwelling, neat and of urban inspiration. It accommodates six one-bedroom bungalows, with the view over the central courtyard, ten three-bedroom lofts, surrounding the bungalows and three two-bedroom units with the view oriented towards the courtyard. The space is envisioned as a spot of comfort and relaxation, where the interaction between neighbors is a pleasant thing to do. The multifamily type of approach, is presented from a very positive perspective by Jonathan Segal. He says that “you get the feeling that all the people who live there have got to be good neighbors to each other.”

Despite this common joy of sharing space and developing a better communication with the ones in your proximity, each and every unit has its private outdoor space. Very interesting and exciting, the interior courtyard buffers the loud traffic sound. The abundance of outdoor spaces creates an equilibrium and encourages people to spend more time relaxing on their terraces, focusing on a green lifestyle in the middle of the urban vibe. The Charmer is rich in interior design details, inspiring elegance and comfort. Patios, fireplaces, ligthweight materials – everything has been carefully designed to celebrate the welfare of the Charmer’s inhabitants.
