Automatic PDF Delivery to your Tablet
By Lim Cheng Soon, 02 July 2012

Few weeks ago, couple of our readers (thanks Robin and Thomas!) told us they wanted the Kindle Direct Delivery feature to send PDF instead of the usual MOBI format. I was puzzled, since it would be too small to read the PDF on Kindle.

Turns out, they (like a lot of readers too, I later found out) use the Kindle app on their tablet. Now that makes perfect sense.

So we quietly rolled out that feature last week. Now you can go to your Subscriber Area to activate it.

And youâ€™ll see the latest issue of Hacker Monthly (in iPad-optimized PDF format) automagically appear on your tablet every month.
