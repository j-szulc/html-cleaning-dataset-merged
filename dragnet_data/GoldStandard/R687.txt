Barack Obama Celebration Photo Becomes ‘Most Liked’ In Facebook History, Also Sets Twitter Record

President Barack Obama celebrated his victory on Tuesday night by sharing a photograph on his Facebook page. That photo which features the President in a warm embrace with First Lady Michelle Obama has quickly become the “most liked” photograph in the history of Facebook.

Under his photo was the simple caption “four more years.”

The Facebook page Facebook + Journalists revealed the new record at approximately 3 a.m. ET. According to the group:

     “With more than 2.1 million likes, this Barack Obama photo is the most-liked Facebook photo of all time.”

At the time of this story the photo has received 3,330,189 likes.

President Obama then shared the same photo and caption on Twitter. Justin Bieber had held the single retweet record with 223,401, now President Obama’s photo destroys that previous world record with 649,575 retweets.

Here is the ful-sized version of the photo via President Obama’s tweet:

Are you surprised by the massive amount of support a single photo received? I have a feeling this was more about the “four more years” declaration than it was about President Obama hugging his wife.
