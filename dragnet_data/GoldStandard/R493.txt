'Ronaldo signing would be great for PSG' - Pastore

Paris Saint-Germain playmaker Javier Pastore has admitted that he would love to see Real Madrid attacker Cristiano Ronaldo sign for the club.

The Portuguese has been linked with a move to Carlo Ancelotti's side in recent weeks and the Argentina international believes the former Manchester United man would have an excellent effect on the squad.

"Ronaldo is one of the world's best players, he scores almost every game," he told L'Equipe.

"He knows how to make the difference on his own. If he signs for PSG, it would be great for the club, and for the players who are already here.

"So I would say yes to him coming!"

Ronaldo scored 46 goals in La Liga last season as Jose Mourinho's side was crowned champions.
