Walker: I want to win the Europa League with Tottenham

Kyle Walker insists Tottenham is serious about winning the Europa League - and the young defender has revealed he would personally love to win the trophy.

Spurs go into Thursday's clash against Maribor with three draws from three games in the competition, but a shock 1-0 home defeat to Wigan on Saturday means they are low on form.

However, the 22-year-old right back feels it is a privilege to feature in a European competition, and thinks boss Andre Villas-Boas would also like to win the trophy he first claimed with Porto.

"Some people aren't even on Channel Five on Thursday nights, so [the Europa League] is definitely something I want to win on a personal level and I am sure the lads and the gaffer want to do as well," he told reporters.

The group is finely balanced with Lazio, Panathiniakos, Spurs and their Thursday night Slovenian opponents all separated by just three points in Group J - but Walker believes all of the club's opponents are beatable.

"No disrespect to them, but these are all winnable games," Walker insisted. "With the players we have in our team - we have world-class internationals - we can win this one, go to Lazio and give them a good game, and beat Panathanaikos and the table will look good come the end of it."
