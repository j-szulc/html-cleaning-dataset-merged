The Weight of Hurricane Sandy

Chris Hayes gave us a barn-burner of a show this weekend, concluding that neutrality on climate change is not an option, and that apathy is effectively a choice. But what really caught me was the segment afterward where Klaus Jacob basically predicted, to a T, the kind of pain and agony that Sandy would inflict upon the city.

My knowledge of climate change, beyond the rudiments, comes from a kind of secondary thinking that supposes that the camp which denies the origins of the Confederate flag, denies evolution, and finds marriage equality icky is probably not the place to look for hard truths on climate change.

But now, having actually seen the elephant in the form of Sandy, I'm finding secondary reasoning insufficient. With that in mind, does the Horde have any books to recommend? I understand the basics of greenhouse gas emissions, but I would really like to deepen my knowledge of the subject. Ideally, such a book would be really clear and well written, but on point in terms of the actual science.

Any solid suggestions are welcome. Basically, if there's a Battle Cry of Freedom for climate change, I'd love to read it.
