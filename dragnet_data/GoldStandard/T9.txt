Sienna Miller and Tom Sturridge brought their newborn daughter, Marlowe Sturridge, out for a walk in London today. Tom and Sienna also stopped for lunch, while Marlowe stayed nestled in her Bugaboo Missoni stroller. The couple welcomed the little one last month, in early July. We had a first look at Sienna Miller's baby yesterday, when the mother-daughter duo strolled near their home with aunt Savannah Miller. Both Sienna and Tom have taken time off from their moviemaking careers in order to focus on their new family. Tom, though, may be called back to the red carpet soon. There will be a London premiere of his On the Road next Thursday, though his costar Kristen Stewart reportedly decided not to attend.
