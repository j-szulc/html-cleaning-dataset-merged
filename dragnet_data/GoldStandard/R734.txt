This Week's Sermon: "The Sovereignty of God: 'My Counsel Shall Stand, and I Will Accomplish All My Purpose'"

by Jonathan Parnell | November 6, 2012



Sermons like these face us with a crucial question: Will we praise God's power and bow in glad submission or will we resist God's power and shake our fists?

God is sovereign over all things. Not a little bit sovereign. Not maybe-sorta-kinda sovereign. But absolutely sovereign. Everything that has happened or will happen is purposed by God to happen.

As a theological trademark of Bethlehem Baptist Church, John Piper expounds the biblical portrait of God's sovereignty and gives seven exhortations for why it is a precious foundational truth.
