R W Glenn on the Fatherhood of God

by Jonathan Parnell | November 6, 2012

Do you know what it means that God is your Father?

R W Glenn believes that many Christians miss out on experiencing the wonderful reality that we are truly loved. Because of Jesus, God's wrath toward us is turned away. We wake up each day accepted as his sons and daughters. "God has no reservations about us whatsoever and he marshals all of his omnipotence to do us good."

In the latest episode of Theology Refresh, David Mathis talks with Glenn about the vital doctrine of God's fatherhood, and even the sinister motivations behind rejecting this truth.
