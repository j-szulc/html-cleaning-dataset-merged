Tesla's Model S roadster has nabbed Motor Trend's 2013 Car of the Year award, making it the first electric car to garner the prize. The EV was voted in unanimously by the publication's judges while beating out the formidable likes of BMW, Porsche and Lexus. In announcing the award, the editors proclaimed the vehicle to be sporty, efficient, spacious and "as smoothly effortless as a Rolls-Royce." Meanwhile, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk opined that gaining the prize over the gas-burners was a "critical step towards the widespread adoption of sustainable transport." Now all the automaker needs to do is ramp up production and it might start to generate cash as well as awards.
