Why Strong Brows Are a Strong Beauty Statement 

ou don't have to wear bold colors to make a bold makeup statement. Ginnifer Goodwin looked striking with soft shades of pink paired with stunning arches at this weekend's LACMA 2012 Art + Film Gala. The structured look complemented her sleek pixie and the embellished neckline of her black Gucci dress. She balanced her bold brows with flirty lashes and thin winged liner.

Looking to frame your eyes with full, well-groomed brows, too? Opt for a brow pencil like Kevyn Aucoin Beauty The Precision Brow Pencil ($24), which features a fine tip to fill in sparse areas or draw a natural looking shape (plus, the brush on the end allows you to groom every hair into place). To achieve more prominent brows, you can exaggerate the shape by slightly elongating the ends. The final touch: set your look with brow gel or wax for a polished finish.
