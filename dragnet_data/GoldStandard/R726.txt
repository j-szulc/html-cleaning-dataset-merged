CRUISING THE STREETS OF NEW YORK 

I just shot this story for Vogue.com on what to wear when cruising around. There’s no need to get the typical skateboarding uniform, especially when you can play around, be feminine and sporty at the same time. See the entire story written by the lovely Esther Adams at Vogue here. I’m wearing a sweater by Acne, skirt by Porter Grey, Sandro shoes, Chanel bag, Prada iPad case and longboard from Uncle Funkys.

    I already read it on Vogue site. It is a cool article, photos and style are great. Special attention to mix of bright skirt and immaculate sneakers.

    So nice picture. I agree with about the fact you don’t need to have the classical uniform of skateboarding. Just ride !
