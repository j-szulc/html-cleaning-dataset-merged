Miral Kotb will direct the show, which features original music by Christopher Tignor and musical direction by Justin "Kanobby" Keitt.

Known for their appearances on NBC's hit series, America's Got Talent, iLuminate perform in light suits creating show that combine music, art, and technological magic.

The show is described as the story of a talented but insecure young artist who struggles to connect with the real world and takes comfort in his magical paintbrush.
