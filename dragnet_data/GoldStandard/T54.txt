Florida State Football Practice Report: Day 4

In the midst of a terrible week of weather, Florida State practiced at 5:30 am again Thursday after doing the same on Wednesday. The energy level was somewhat surprisingly high, with most of the team seeming to come prepared to work, despite the early hour.

Lonnie Pryor said after practice that he and his teammates had to get up around 4:30, but Jimbo Fisher said after practice that he was pleased with the energy level.

With the players still in shells, it’s a little early to draw too many conclusions about the depth chart, but it’s clear that the pecking order at wideout is still being settled, as is the offensive line. While the unit of Erving-Matias-Barron-Jackson-Stork took some reps, the center and right tackle positions saw a few different looks.

Bryan Stork spent plenty of time at center with the ones, while Daniel Glauser, Bobby Hart, and Menelik Watson all got some time at right tackle with the top unit. The results were a bit mixed, with Glauser in particular struggling against Bjoern Werner. Fisher said he liked what Stork did at center and wanted to get a couple of other guys reps at tackle. It seems there’s a real chance that Stork will be at center this season, assuming a suitable replacement at right tackle can be found. The staff is trying every possible combination.

Here's a great photo from Ira Schoffel.

The situation at cornerback appears to remain the same as it’s been all week, with Nick Waisome still taking over Greg Reid’s field corner spot with the ones. Ronald Darby may be worth keeping an eye on in that competition, though. He drew rave reviews from Jimbo Fisher, and Lamarcus Joyner also singled him out as a freshman that has impressed him.

As you would expect with the amount of depth the team has at the position, the wide receiver spots were mixed up a good amount too. Rodney Smith and Rashad Greene worked almost exclusively with the top unit, with a few others getting into the mix. Kelvin Benjamin saw some reps, and the slot duties with the ones fell mostly to Kenny Shaw and Scooter Haggins. Christian Green and Willie Haulstead primarily worked with the second unit, as did Greg Dent. Dent was another player who received praise from Fisher after practice.

The quarterback situation appears stable for now as well, with Manuel, Trickett, and Coker 1-2-3 and the freshmen, Jameis Winston and Sean McGuire, behind them. Coker threw some pretty deep balls for touchdowns during drills, including one to Shaw and one to Greene.

Notes:


    Fisher said he liked the effort and energy, but wanted to see more consistency. "Giving up too many big plays on defense… our effort’s good but we’ve got to execute better on offense and defense," he said.
    Fisher said he doesn’t love the 5:30 am start since its difficult on the players, but said the team wouldn’t have been able to practice the past two days without the early start.
    Lamarcus Joyner was a player whose energy stood out despite practice beginning before sunrise. Fisher praised him for it.
    While Winston and Maguire are at the bottom of the QB depth chart, Fisher said he likes both players’ arm talent and isn’t babying them. "Throw it at the wall and see what sticks, find out who can play and what they can handle," he said of his approach of throwing everything at the rookies.
    The running backs continued to draw positive reviews from Fisher, too. Chris Thompson had another good practice, and Fisher also noted that Devonte Freeman and James Wilder practiced well. Lonnie Pryor continued to get some reps at both running back and fullback.
    Fisher mentioned he’s looking for more consistency specifically from the wide outs, as well as better use of their physical abilities to go up and get balls in the air. "You gotta make plays when guys are being tightly covered, use your size and power, and physical over people," he said. Fisher also had positive words about the improved quickness of Benjamin in his route running.
    Both Pryor and Joyner said it was tough to get up and going at such an early hour, but that once the team got rolling, it wasn’t bad.
    Pryor said he’s been enjoying getting some reps at both running back and fullback, and that he’s slimmed back down closer to his weight from his sophomore year, around 220, at the request of the coaching staff.
    Pryor also said the team has practiced differently this year, doing more walkthroughs and other tweaks to keep the team fresher when the season rolls around. He noted that Fisher hasn’t changed on the field though. "He’s still the same old guy on the field, getting after us," Pryor said. Joyner said the team was ready for the early practice. "Everybody was ready for it", he said. "We’re trying to win, and if that means getting up at 4:30, that’s what we’re gonna do."
    Joyner seemed pretty impressed with Darby. He even said Darby is probably a little bit ahead of where he was as a freshman in terms of technique. He also praised Waisome and Tyler Hunter.
    While he said if the coaches decided against it he would step back, Joyner said he hopes to remain on kick returns this season.

What's the most logical way to look at the Corner situation?

Ronald Darby is just great. 2nd best Corner on the team by the end of the year. Or…Or… Waisome, Keelin Smith Etc. are just not going to hit a high ceiling or if they do hit a high ceiling it’s going to take years?

by TheCloser... on Aug 9, 2012 10:41 AM EDT    
I doubt Darby is the 2nd best corner by the end of the year...

He has the talent and work ethic that will help him transition fairly quickly to the college game and could possibly surpass some players and see a lot of playing time his sophomore year gearing him up to start his Junior season. I think as of right now; Tyler Hunter is probably the 2nd best corner on the team. But Brooks would probably be the 2nd if he ever plays corner. I think Darby has more upside then Waisome or Keelin because he could be groomed to play either boundary or field whereas I think Waisome is more relegated to being a field corner and Keelin is more relegated to being a boundary corner….

by zone3nole on Aug 9, 2012 12:22 PM EDT    
Disagree with Darby not starting till his Jr year.

I see him getting a little PT this year and starting over Waisome next year.

Yea I could see that; I just didn't want to jump the gun...

Tyler Hunter could possibly move over and replace Rhodes and Darby could be the field w/ Keelin at nickel…

by zone3nole on Aug 9, 2012 12:47 PM EDT    
I think Darby starts at some point this year I think, Hunter stays at the nickle no matter what (important position)

Brooks ain’t moving I don’t think, I don’t think we have enough info on any of the players to say who’s the 2nd best corner to be honest. Darby may not go into the year starting but I think he could finish starting…

Why? Waisome was a top-five corner in the class of 2011.

by Bud Elliott on Aug 9, 2012 10:55 AM EDT    
I think most are not sold on his size, strength and speed.

And saw him in the that small sample size that was the spring game when he got beat over the top.

This is the first day that anybody has said anything about Waisome good or bad

Waisome ceiling isn’t high because of his height and speed I believe. If I’m taking a small corner they need to be a bulldog and have game like Joe Haden or Janoris

by garnet&gold4life on Aug 9, 2012 11:02 AM EDT via mobile    
He's 2 inches taller than G5 and we run a zone cover scheme.

I’m anticipating addition through subtraction.

Hunter is my first choice, but I’m completely comfortable with Waisome if he wins the job.

by BobLoblaw113 on Aug 9, 2012 12:34 PM EDT    
I think the coaches want Hunter at S not CB

Agree though, I’m a big fan of Hunter’s game.

Championship!

by TLHWG on Aug 9, 2012 12:50 PM EDT    
He is 2 inches taller and that's about it

G5 was much stronger and probably faster. I hope Waisome proves me wrong because I wanna see all the players do well but so far I don’t see it. I know Darby is a freshman but he is bigger stronger faster better instincts and he is making splash plays. I could care less about Waisome being technically sound because none of that matters if you are getting blown by and or Mossed down field on a regular basis. The best players will win out eventually

by garnet&gold4life on Aug 9, 2012 12:37 PM EDT via mobile    
G5 also had 3 full years in the system before he was tossed

Waisome only has 1 so far. It’s still early in the process for him, but he’ll get there, don’t worry.

If Waisome wins out I'm fine

I know Fisher and Co will be objective and put the best player on the field

by garnet&gold4life on Aug 9, 2012 1:41 PM EDT via mobile    
What is this based on? How do you know G5 was faster and stronger?

Waisome is a tad taller, and I believe they are near the same weight. From everything I have read they are about the same speed, and Waisome might be a tad faster.

As much as you are hyping G5, you are forgetting the times that he got blown by, bit on pump fakes and got “Mossed” down field.

I do like Darby, and I think he will be great. But don’t let the ship sail on Waisome before he plays.

by TimScribble on Aug 9, 2012 1:12 PM EDT    
I'm definitely not hyping Greg Reid

All I’m saying is I would rather have a corner that’s better than Greg Reid instead of a 2" taller clone. Like I said before I hope Waisome is a player but up until today he hasn’t been talked about at all and even though the spring game is a small sample size, he kinda showed why nobody has said anything about him

by garnet&gold4life on Aug 9, 2012 1:33 PM EDT via mobile

you don’t have to be the biggest or the fastest. Technique and instincts rule over speed in the zone. JMHO

I agree but FSU plays more than just zone

Waisome was in man when he got beat badly by Greg Dent in the spring game.

by garnet&gold4life on Aug 9, 2012 1:38 PM EDT via mobile    
from the practice reports

Waisome is doing good. He hasn’t won the starting job, but sounds like he has the lead.

Championship!

by TLHWG on Aug 9, 2012 1:50 PM EDT    
And Greg Dent is a Junior...

he should be beating Waisome…. Plus he’s a very good receiver so you can’t hold that on Waisome…

by zone3nole on Aug 9, 2012 2:05 PM EDT    

or have a uncanny ability to hold and pass interfere on every play but not get called for it like joe haden

Give the guy some reps in the season, then pick him apart if he falls flat. Never know, he may kill it.

by woodstocknole on Aug 9, 2012 12:31 PM EDT    
I think Go Gata's remarks after he decommitted have affected some of us.

Waisome has plenty of ability to play at this level, he’s young and inexperienced. Give him a chance to develop for crying out loud.

by Jtyler998 on Aug 9, 2012 12:01 PM EDT    
Curious, why do you not want Waisome?

Is it because of his height? Waisome was a pretty high recruit coming in.

by TimScribble on Aug 9, 2012 10:55 AM EDT    
Not particularly fast, not tall, and I know it was just the spring game but he really didn't do anything that would make me think he is our next bet corner behind XR

My thought exactly

by EricNole on Aug 9, 2012 11:23 AM EDT    
Where is this coming from?

He was reportedly timed at 4.44 in the forty, and was voted best cover guy at the 2011 Under Armour game. Seems a lot of misinformation continues to spread. He is not a scrub as Bud mentioned. Self reported that he beat Karlos in a race. Size and strength are a legit concern, but the speed is a bit overblown. He is also reportedly 5’10 with long arms so not sure where the heigth issues stem from.

Not saying this will translate to the college game, but he is definitely one who most were extremely excited about when he flipped from FL.

by HBCU93 on Aug 9, 2012 1:05 PM EDT    
Plus he's not going to be behind XR...

two different positions. We’re asking him to play the Greg Reid role at Field Corner. His pure cover corner skills should translate greatly at that position because of his strength as a cover corner….

by zone3nole on Aug 9, 2012 1:16 PM EDT    

It almost seems like people view Waisome as Sojourn Shelton-like in terms of ability.

Consistency is only a good thing if your sauce is at a high level.

From what I’ve tasted, his sauce is definitely lacking in intensity and flavor.

I need to see some real good focus on his fundamentals before I’m gonna be satisfied with what he’s putting out there on that table.

RT....

As long as the center can snap it in shotgun without EJ having to grab it off the ground.

by EZnole52811 on Aug 9, 2012 11:14 AM EDT    
Stork got yanked from center last year because he couldn't make the

right checks at the line. He was also pressed into service because Krug didn’t exactly work out either. I hope Stork, given time to work at center can become a good one. Then Watson wins RT, then my pick for starting o-line will be right on the money and I will look like the genius I am. (I know almost nothing about o-line. Just that, “those guys are the biggest, put them in.”)

Knowing is half the battle, the other half is violence.

by onebarrelrum on Aug 9, 2012 11:17 AM EDT    
If Stork is solid at RT why try others at RT and Barron is a serviceable center?

Are they just trying to see if somebody else can handle the position? The OL would be huge with Stork at center and either Hart Watson or Glauser at RT

by garnet&gold4life on Aug 9, 2012 11:24 AM EDT via mobile    
We don't know if Barron is serviceable at center.

by onebarrelrum on Aug 9, 2012 11:26 AM EDT    
You partially answered your own question.

Think of it as aggregate grades from the components.

Based on his spring game and previous play, I’d say Stork is an overall B- RT and a B Center. Barron is probably a C+/B- center. If FSU can get B- play out of Glauser or Watson, the aggregate line grade is higher.

C, actually, which seems counter-intuitive.

    Above all, we want guys who want play so bad they could die. We want guys who can run, who are athletic, who have “recoverability”, but who maybe lacks bulk and strength. Maybe doesn’t know what his body is about yet. We want guys who are going to take advantage of that redshirt year.

    TACKLES: Tall, length, maybe no basic strength, but he can run, and we’re willing to let him add that power. 6’5 1/2" is usually the max we want.

    GUARDS & CENTERS: height and length doesn’t mean ****. Marginal height, but plays with great leverage. “LOW WAISTED” (long torso short legs), with leverage under our bodies. Healthier by not being heavy. RARE for them to play early. Nobody over 6’3". My center must be football brilliant.

Knowing is half the battle, the other half is violence.

by onebarrelrum on Aug 9, 2012 11:29 AM EDT    
Actually, no.

Some of our biggest runs last year (like the years before that) were on outside zone plays. Our inside zone runs were just trash. So OZO stays, and I think IZO should only improve.

Also, IZO resembles a man blocking scheme if you think about it. So it wouldn’t be a huge upgrade. If anything, now linemen have to learn plays like “If we run left, I double-down on the DT and try to get to the backer.” IZO here basically gives you rules instead of assignments: “I am responsible for everything in my 3×3′ box. Where they are dictates my angle and who I pick up.”

I havnt paid much attention to O-Line practices and battles in the past

Do we usually have this many players rotating between the 1’s and 2’s and amongst the various positions on the line during practices? I know about the cross training positions etc. but do teams ever have it to where there is a set cohesive 5 man unit that takes multiple repetitions together on 1st team or is there always mixing and matching?

This sentence is a little unsettling.

    The staff is trying every possible combination.

I think it would be bad if they had clear 1s already

They are all young, so that would mean the fall off was bad among them. Think of it as optimizing with trying different combos and seeing who is just slightly better in different spots. I don’t think it is ‘crap, this won’t work, try something else’.

It may be unsettling but

the alternative is more unsettling. And let’s be clear: every possible combination is only being considered with the C-RT combination. And since it sounds like the staff really prefer Stork (to Barron) at C, the real test is who is the best possible RT: Glauser, Watson, Hart.

I love that Vic is out there with the team

not really coaching, but pumping them up, motivating, praising, etc. How many other S&C coaches do that all the time? Is that expected of them? Anyway I’m glad that he’s doing it, the players seem to really respond in practices and games.

I think it’s nice to have a coach who isn’t directly involved in the game, who isn’t going to scream at you for making a mistake, etc., who you can go to for support during the game. Obviously have to have the RT types who will get in your face too, but it’s good to have both.

at the overall outcome and think about how worst it could’ve been last season rather than be so critical of EJ.

I think a key is he's got to trust the guys in front of him if he's going to make progress.

And to do that, he’s going to have to be shown that he can trust the guys in front of him. He can still become a great QB, but the OL absolutely needs to protect him for that to happen.

People learn and progress best when they’re in a reasonable state of mind, and panic is not a reasonable state of mind. When you’re getting crushed no matter what you do or decide, no amount of coaching or advice will sink in, because his primary problems are not internal, they are external.

It’s Maslow’s hierarchy of needs: one needs to feel safe, secure, appreciated and confident before self-actualization can happen. EJ’s plenty appreciated and very confident, but safety and security is more fundamental than that, and he definitely wasn’t feeling very safe and secure last year.

+Infinity on this....

Security in knowing that you won’t be hit allows you to free your mind into enabling you to be the best QB you can be… Knowing that you’re going to get hit by a 300-lb D-lineman everytime you take the snap has to be very nerve racking in itself. Example: We see how Tom Brady is when he’s comfortable in the pocket and feeling secure; and then we see how Brady is when he’s getting hit and feeling insecure. Day and Night…And EJ has handled that better than pretty much anybody I can remember. I think about what EJ would do w/ USC’s Oline protecting him last season and then I think about what Matt Barkley would do w/ EJ’s Oline protecting him. I doubt a pure pocket passer in Matt would even come close to leading FSU into a 10-4 season…

I don't get the anti Waisome bias

No one really knows how good or bad he might end up being. If he plays smart and disciplined, there is a strong chance that FSU will get more from him than they did from G5 (strictly as a cornerback) in his freshman season. The dramatic improvement in the offensive line and the now entrenched nature of the zone scheme together should make a huge difference.

In a comparable number of snaps to freshman Reid, I will go out on a limb and say he gets 4 interceptions (Reid had 3 his first year) and at least 5 fewer busted tackles where he fails to break down/wrap up.

I definitely have high hopes for Waisome...

People are over-looking him because he doesn’t have that superstar appeal to him but I think his cover skills will definitely be noticed once the season roles around.

by zone3nole on Aug 9, 2012 12:33 PM EDT    
I think

It has to do with the expectations associated with our secondary as possibly being the best in the nation before losing Reid.

I don’t think anyone is going to be be able to stand back in the pocket and throw on us anyway, so I’m not overly concerned about who ends up playing the field, since I expect we will get consistent pressure from the front seven and will therefore have flexibility to use the safeties to give the FC help.

by fsu44 on Aug 9, 2012 12:34 PM EDT

He's so highly touted, everyone's expecting him to play like a senior

But instead he’s playing like a sophomore.

People forget that sophomore CBs generally don’t look like they’re any good until the end of the season. It takes time to hone your instincts at CB, and most sophomores just don’t have the large amount of PT needed to have that kind of institutional knowledge yet.

That XR did look good last year just shows how insanely good he is and why we project him to jump to the NFL early.

He’s got game experience now, which means he can be counted upon and knows more of what to do right than anybody behind him.

on a flip side ... does it mean that Werner is doing better than we thought?!

How bad is Xaviers knee?

Fisher’s interview says he’s not near as healthy as first thought and he actually had to come out reps for awhile?

He looks like he's limping pretty bad in the vid

Wait, people don't think Nick Waisome is strong?

I remember Moody tweeting (in the PreBan era) that Waisome hit 275 clean. Which, coincidentally, is the max clean of all of Clemson’s OL.

Is Jernigan allowed to practice with the team despite not knowing if his summer grades are passing?

I know that, but was asking if he was legally allowed to be

Bcuz if not, someone should say something to the videographer to stay the hell away from recording footage of #8

your academic eligibility is based on your last completed semester

summer grades haven’t come in yet so he is still going off spring grades. also see: NBA-bound 1-and-done’ers not showing up for class their entire spring semester.

Waisome clearly underrated

Think we’re underestimating him little bit, the coaches are clearly comfortable with him…

Its always the underestimated guy....

that comes in and surprises everyone during the season.. Hopefully Waisome fits that mold…

Waisome had a ton of great offers and was highly recruited

I think the issue is he just looks so small on the football field and it does not inspire confidence.

    Fisher mentioned he’s looking for more consistency specifically from the wide outs, as well as better use of their physical abilities to go up and get balls in the air. “You gotta make plays when guys are being tightly covered, use your size and power, and physical over people,” he said. 

I’ve been complaining about this forever on here. Our WRs have a soft mentality when the ball’s in the air. I sort of put that on Dawsey because it’s a unit wide issue. Only a couple of our WRs actually go up and make plays on the ball (Dent’s one of them, which is why I’ve always hoped he’s not asked to leave as has been insinuated on here on occasion). I want WRs with a wide catch radius and that high point the ball. Know how to use your body for positioning. It makes a difference.
