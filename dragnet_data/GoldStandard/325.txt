What's in the box?

We hesitate.

We stall or try for perfect or have meetings or polish or avoid the final 'go' because we're afraid that it might not work, that the art won't be well received, that people will hate it.

Here's the thing: there's a box on the table. And you need to decide whether or not you're going to open it. All the wishing and planning and imagining isn't going to change what's already in the box. The act of opening it doesn't deserve anxiety because the contents of the box were determined a long time ago. What's in the box is in the box, regardless of how much anxiety goes into opening it.

Sure, do a great job, the best job you can do with the resources you've got. But then quit imagining and go ahead and open the box.
