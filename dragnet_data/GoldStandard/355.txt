San Diego Zoo Safari Park Excursion!

Well, one of us has gotten a year older, (ahem...Cristina) and we thought it would be fitting to go on an adventure to commemorate the momentous occasion! We really love seeing animals, but we've already been to the San Diego Zoo...so what's a nutty nomad to do? Luckily for us, the Safari Park is a great option!

If you love seeing wildlife, but are saddened by the small cages, then the park is a nice compromise. Here, animals that are used to grazing and roaming free in the wild are able to act naturally to some degree. It's amazing to watch different species of animal in one, giant field, which we were told could house the entire San Diego Zoo!! Visitors can ride the safari tram through the enclosure and see the animals up close! Well, not THAT close, but as close as one would want to be to a giant rhino...

What type of animals roam? Giraffes, Rhinos and Gazelle to name a few...don't worry though, the lions and cheetahs are kept in a different area! Which brings us to one of the highlights of this facility. There is an attraction called the Cheetah Run, where onlookers can watch in awe as a cheetah chases a target down a specially built cheetah path at 60-70 mph! Pretty cool!

Other stops we enjoyed include the bat exhibit, where large fruit bats were hanging out, eating melons; the world gardens, which are large, cultivated areas that are home to various species of plants from all over, and the Lagoon Loop, where ducks walk freely and are accustomed to being fed by zoo visitors.
We stayed until they kicked us out! There is so much to see, so be sure to plan and get to the park early if you want to visit every nook and cranny before it closes. This place really is fascinating, and we hope to get the chance to visit again someday!
