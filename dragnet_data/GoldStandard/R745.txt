Every year, millions of Americans forget what is Sexy.

A hand on the hip—is that sexy? Kind of. A water bottle on its side—is that sexy? It could be I guess. A kitten who is malicious—no. A kitten who is naughty—definitely.

Thankfully, we have the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, lingerie's annual celebration of the vague shape of a wing, to tell us what is sexy.

Here is what is sexy, according to this year's runway show:

SEXY IS: Shrinking down so you're smaller than a clover and dressing like your great grandfather.
