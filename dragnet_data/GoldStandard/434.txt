The next iPod Touch may receive a hefty makeover.



The next iPod Touch may join the next iPhone is bumping up its screen size, according to new reports.

Citing its "Asian sources," Japanese blog site Macotakara claims that the fifth-generation iPod Touch will offer a four-inch LCD display, just like the upcoming new iPhone. But that's not all.

The next iPod Touch could be equipped with the same processor found on the iPhone 4S, say Macotakara's sources, which means an upgrade from the A4 to the A5 chip. Other specs may match that of the iPhone 4S as well. The next model will reportedly have a different back-case style -- buffed aluminum instead of the polished stainless steel mirror design. And potential buyers may get a choice of black or white.

The next-gen iPod Touch also has an extra hole on the lower part of the back case, but the sources had no clue as to its purpose.

Adding further fuel to the fire, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo issued a report yesterday saying that a new iPod Touch is in the works, as reported by MacRumors. The next model will be equipped with the same in-cell touch display technology reportedly slated for the next iPhone. Such technology helps keep the device thin and light.

Kuo believes Apple will launch the new iPod Touch in September or October, the same time the next iPhone is expected to debut.
