From revealingpolitics.com comes these outrageous responses from Obama supporters outside the joint President Obama-Sandra Fluke campaign event in Denver on Wednesday.

The interviewees were all dead-set on the government not having any place in the bedroom. But following that up with why then should the government pay for the contraception used in the bedroom, they seemed to falter.

“The government has no place in our bedroom?” interviewer Caleb Bonham asked one woman.

“No,” she asserted.

“So you’re in support of contraception, government-funded contraception — why do you believe the government should pay for what goes on inside your bedroom?”

The woman paused before answering, “That’s a very good question.”

And then there was the interviewee who declared she was “like, all for abortion, all for birth control.”

“So, you don’t think the government should be involved in what goes on inside the bedroom, correct?” Bonham repeated.

“Oh exactly, oh not even close, no,” she replied.

“So then why do you expect the government to pay for what goes on inside the bedroom?”

Another pause. “Because…”

The woman in the next clip at least had an answer to that, stating, “if we had that more readily available then we wouldn’t have people out here starving, wouldn’t have–”

“So contraception solves hunger?” Bonham asked.

“Well I believe it has a big part in it, I really do,” she said.

    So, it‘s terrible if Republican candidates don’t tell Rush he’s out of line, but it‘s okay if Obama doesn’t tell Harry Reid that he’s out of line when he calls someone guilty of a felony with no evidence at all. So, in other words, Conservatives are bad and Liberals are good even when their actions (or the lack thereof) are virtually identical. – hypocrisy
    Liberals are all about choice, but it’s okay to take the freedom of choice from the taxpayers if I can get free stuff from them. – egocentricity, ignorance
    Conclusion: Liberal thinking is “choices and free stuff for me even if they take it away from others to do it.” – So much for equal justice and rights with Liberals.
    Keep thinking like that and they’ll eventually come to take your choices and your stuff. Isn’t “Liberal” supposed to mean free? Liberals are working towards the very opposite. It’s not about equality, not about freedom with Liberals… it’s “the world revolves around ME!”
    So much for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness – these stupid women ignore everything America is about for purely selfish reasons and they look like total idiots trying to justify themselves, yet the Conservatives are considered the greedy ones?

    I don’t care what the odds makers in the UK think. Romney will win this election by at least 7%. In the end, it’s going to look more like Reagan vs Carter than Bush vs Gore. It won’t even be close. Just tell these stupid people to come out and vote on November 8. They won‘t know the difference until it’s too late.

    Right….what gets me is that there seems to be the notion that there is only ONE solution to problem that arises when a person creates a baby that they can’t take care of….abort it.

    Everyone’s looking for the solution AFTER the tragedy has happend. Why not look BEFORE?

    Like in most other areas of life….its almost always better to be PROACTIVE than to be REACTIVE.

    Being proactive (displaying self disipline and keeping priorities in check) helps our society as a whole in MANY more ways other than preventing unwanted pregnacies. Proping up values like self disipline helps in the areas of personal finances and a more risk adverse lifestlyle….AND COSTS THE TAX PAYER NOTHING.

    On the other side of the coin, relying on a medical procedure to remedy the problem AFTER the fact teaches nothing but dependence and provides little consequence to undisiplined behavior. Undisiplined behavior (AGAIN) feeds into all other aspects of life….AND it has a HUGE impact to the Tax Payer (who doesn‘t get to play part in that person’s personal decision…but is on the hook from a liability perspective)

      August 9, 2012 at 1:19pm

    Exactly…it seems to be ok to go out there and do what it takes to make babies all day long…solution…just abort it….so sad…no accountability anymore…no morality….just get rid of the evidence..it is shockingly sad that parents are not teaching simple morality anymore. Abstinance is lost forever it would seem…so sad….

    Apples & Oranges

    The ultrasound requirement is not exactly probing….but there to give some gravity to the situation. It’s like paying for something with cash vs. a credit card. You tend to think more about what your doing when you have something tangible in hand. I think most opponets to this are more worried about this provision hurting the cause (guilt free abortions) more than your concern for the womans rights.

    I’d prefer that no money go to these programs at all, but you’re going to have a tough time trying to equate interfearing Dems pushing for the killing of featuses and interfearing GOP pushing for preventative screenings. Performing an abortion is much more evasive than some KY jelly covered device sliding around your belly.

    Again, gov should get out of all of this…..but getting all sensitive about women being invaded with ultrasounds, but turning a blind eye when a living being inside gets aborted doesn‘t help win over folks that don’t agree or understand your position.

    People don’t have to live with their decisions anymore…the government is there to make everything better even for the stupid among us. But the day is coming when we won‘t only say that we’re broke, but when we actually will be broke. And those with their hands out won’t receive anything at all. And those who were paying for their laziness will be too busy taking care of themselves to be able to pay for lethargy. Death is the ultimate solution. Promoting this lifestyle of government reliance is only dooming more people to a tragic end, but people like Piehole just don’t understand. The real Hunger Games are about to start, and people like him will be waiting for someone to wipe their a$$ while people like us will be taking care of our family.

    I just don’t care anymore. This nation is crumbling and there is no correcting it. If the government should pay for any type of birth control, it should be permanent. Tie their tubes if they’re unable to pay $30 a month and don’t want kids. For the men who can’t afford a condom, snip snip.

    @ Joe.R.Piehole…..we understand that in the Liberal/Progessive/Democrat world that you all see stupid as actually being smart and smart as being stupid. See the thing about a lot of the Blaze posters (i’m not saying all because there are some that are some that are out there) have college degrees, common sense and we have real life knowledge.

    Whereas it is evident that more and more liberals/progressives/democrats only have book smarts (if even that). They have the ability to read something and then repeat it back, but they don’t have the ability to actually rationalize and follow a thought out. However, they are so quick to point out how smart they are…..but anyone can simply repeat what they are told to do.
