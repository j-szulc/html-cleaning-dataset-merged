	
Can 187,586 Buyers Be Wrong? Consumer Reports Thinks So
By Derek Kreindler on August 9, 2012 

“Just because a car generates a lot of buzz or is a best seller doesn’t mean that it’s a good choice for you. The five models here may be on a lot of buyers’ shopping lists, but we suggest you steer clear…”

So says Consumer Reports with respect to their list of “Five popular cars to avoid”. CR says that the vehicles “…didn’t perform well in our testing or they suffer from subpar reliability,” and that’s reason enough to stay away. I’m not entirely convinced.

We at TTAC respect the hell out of Consumer Reports. Unlike other parties in the buff book business, we never crack appliance-related jokes about their testing methods or dismiss them as lab coated slide-ruler jockeys. When they have something to say, we take it seriously.

Whipping boy number one is, of course, the 2012 Honda Civic. There are elements within TTAC who don’t like the car, for valid reasons. But as I explored in a previous column, it does have enough merit that it’s worth buying. And it’s been vetted by my Grandma. CR even recommends the Subaru Impreza over the Honda Civic; make no mistake, it’s a nice car, but there’s no way that they can criticize the Civic’s “mediocre interior” while ignoring the Impreza.

CR also lists the Dodge Grand Caravan, Toyota Prius c, Ford Edge V6 and Jeep Liberty as vehicles to stay away from. Having had inadequate seat time in them, I can’t say in good faith how accurate these picks are. Feel free to let me know in the comments.

Per the link:

-The Dodge Caravan isn’t recommended because of its below-average reliability as reported in the reliability survey.

-CR didn’t like the Civic, Prius c and Liberty as a result of their testing. They weren’t criticizing those vehicles based upon their reliability scores.

-Not only did the Ford Edge V6 do poorly in CR’s testing, but it also performed badly on the reliability survey.

If you happen to like the Civic, then nobody’s stopping you from buying one; it probably won’t break. But if you buy a Grand Caravan and you end up having problems with it, then don’t pretend to be surprised.

    Agree with the Dodge Grand Caravan. Having owned one, can attest to the niggling gremlins and some serious problems that kept the “mini”van from being a favourite and without a doubt, the most time of any car I’ve owned at the dealership for repair issues.

    Didn’t the Caravan get a new drivetrain this year? Hard to believe they’re grenading already.

    edit–Shoulda read the link first. Looks like most of the complaints aren’t drivetrain related, except MPG, which one assumes applies to latest iteration.

We could argue the point of why these cars are good and bad all day long but if someone really loves a car their going to buy it no matter what the review of them says.

    Which is why the Caravan remains at or near the top of the minivan sales chart. It may or may not be the ‘best’, but it sells that way.

        The Caravan doesn’t sell because anybody loves it, or thinks it’s the best, or even that it’s all that good.

        The Caravan sells because it costs $6-8,000 less than a Sienna or Odyssey.

CR does have what amounts to systemic bias: they ding cars for not meeting specific criteria. As long as the implications are properly understood by consumers, there’s nothing wrong with that. For example, they dump on Jeep Wrangler in every issue for its lack of “road manners”. Liberty gets the same treatment, and it’s fully deserved. In the same time, it’s a great buy (for a little longer yet: it’s in its final model year). When I bought Wrangler, I was fully aware of CR’s Not Recommended rating. Informed consumer is not the same as weak-minded consumer.

    Good point. For your average commuter, a Liberty (or Wrangler) isn’t a great choice. But if you need a CUV that can handle a bit of off-roading, it’s worth a look.

    CR has hardly been the only one; numerous auto publications dinged the “new” Civic when it came out.

    Also, there’s a reason why Honda has had to use incentives on the “new” Civic to push sales (while the new CR-V needs no such help) and why Honda is rushing out a refresh for the Civic.

As I pointed out last year, it was inevitable (well, in retrospect) that CR would be controversial… in the age of Web 2.0, the print publications have really struggled to keep pace with the electronic guys. By the time CR had taken their turn at the bat, a number of other reviews had already dropped. It simply wouldn’t have been enough to say that it was another Civic and it was great… that’s not going to fly when management signs off on the piece. It’s an important car, it will be a well read issue, and the other guys have scooped you… like I said, it was almost inevitable. For all the current Civic’s short comings, sales isn’t one of them, but unfortunately CR is entrenched now.

(This isn’t just a new-media / old media situation. Us photog fans saw a similar thing with DPReview… they were quite late with reviews during an 18 month period, and got scooped by the competition to the point that their exhaustive technical reviews weren’t that relevant anymore… this led to some eyebrow raising writing on their part, again, to remain relevant)

I think the Civic brand to this point is selling largely on its reputation. The particular faults of the car according to CR (I’ve never sat in the current gen) are apparently enough to knock it from recommended status. But I don’t think that such a rebuke would be enough to stop the masses from buying a Civic based on the stellar reputation it has garnered over the last few decades. I think it’ll take another generation or two of truly lackluster performance before the public sits up and truly starts to speak through their wallets.

Is it a bad car? I’m sure it’s not. But some may argue that it’s not up to Honda’s own standards let alone the current crop of competition it now faces, and to give it a free pass and argue that sales must mean that it’s a good car, can only give Honda license to continue on this downward trend of blandness and cost-cutting that they are apparently on.

The true-believers will continue to buy the car in droves. But I for one am glad that some groups are calling Honda out on it to keep them on their toes.

    I agree with you on Civic mostly selling by previous reputation, but Camry is a shadow of its former self in terms of value and materials, and yet it moves 400K units.

        Both the “new” Camry and Civic are selling on price more than ever before (as well as fleet for the Camry; even Honda is selling more Civic to fleet thru dealerships).

        Both have lost marketshare in their respective segments.

        You guys are all right. And (here comes the admission) I’m a big Honda fan. Not a fanboi or die-hard believer, but if I were to profess any sentimentality to any brand, it would be Honda.

        As such, I saw the direction that Honda has been taking of late with great disappointment. The fact that the current Civic comes over as a warmed-over and in some respects inferior rehash of the 8G makes me worry that Honda is spending too much of its efforts in breathing life into the aimless Acura brand than focusing on its core.

        28, to your point that the Camry moves 400k units while finding better and better ways to eviscerate the spirit of its predecessors makes me sad that what we’re seeing here is the Camry-fication of the Civic in a similar manner.

        Does the Civic sell to fleets? I thought many on the internet swear to the gods that only American compacts do.

    Saying ‘Can X number of buyers be wrong?’ reminds me of the fact that the ’82 Cutlas Supreme was the best selling car in America…

    Clearly the Civic isn’t garbage but the competetion has moved past simply having to make something that’s reliable.

    I would bet a huge portion of those new Civic buyers aren’t “car” people and aren’t even aware of what the publications are saying. All they know is that new Civic sure drives nice compared to their 8 year old POS.

    Interesting that of the cars CD recommends as an alternative to the Civic–Impreza, Elantra, Mazda 3–none has a great reputation for reliability, in my mind at least. And in this market segment, reliability trumps interior quality any day.

    Like FreddyM, I’m a bit sentimental about Honda too, for what it’s worth. I’m not saying those alternatives are junk, but Skyactiv is too new to judge, Hyundai’s been improving but I’m not sure they’re there yet, and when I hear Subaru I think “head gasket”. Yes, Honda’s tech is getting old, but it’s darn solid tech.

    I don’t take CR’s opinions on driving dynamics very seriously, but I don’t find anything suspect about their reliability reports.

    Their test opinions and recommendations are simply aimed at a different consumer, a consumer that would probably consider their car to be an appliance.

        Actually, I don’t think CR is any different from the more enthusiast oriented publications when it comes to driving dynamics – it’s just for CR, DD plays a much smaller role when it comes to overall analysis and things like rear head/leg rooma and trunk space are more heavily weighted.

        For instance, when it comes to Japanese makes, CR praises Nissan and Mazda for DD and dings Toyota.

        DaveDFW,

        Then you haven’t been looking very closely.

        For one thing, any recommendations they make based on reliability are based on a survey conducted back in April 2011–16 months ago. Vehicles with poor scores over a year ago could be much improved at this point. But they have no way of knowing this, so they just put their old data in a new bottle and keep issuing recommendations.

        Also, note that one of their “popular” vehicles has, as recently reported on TTAC, gone out of production. They clearly put a lot of thought into this list. Generally their road test crew is much more thorough and worth paying attention to than the reliability survey group. Not so much this time.

    Hardly fair criticism. CR is not meant for serious car enthusiasts. It’s for people who want an honest, non-corporation funded appraisal of durable goods. It is fair to say that CR assesses their cars as appliances, no soul or excitement value added, which the majority of Americans seem to want. Solid, dependable transportation that their neighbor will nod their head approvingly of; i.e., a Toyota.

It’s fair to say that for the money there are better cars than the Civic. It’s also fair for them to go out of their way to point that fact out since the Civic used to be as good or better than anything else in the class. It may be Gramma approved, but there is value in an objective source that can look past the new car smell and excitement.

I think many mediocre cars sell well because people get in them and are excited with the newness of it all. Compared to an older, lived in, possibly smelly car any new car seems just great.

I don’t think it comes as any great shock that the Jeep and Dodge have reliability issues, and that the Jeep may have a poor ride for the class. They’re looking at it compared to every vehicle in its class, not through the eyes of someone who wants a Jeep for all the qualities the brand is known for.

I can’t speak on the Imprezza as I’ve yet to even see one in person. I’d bet that the AWD, much improved mpg, and largely equivelant reliability play a large role in them recommending it over the Civic.

CR is an outstanding resource for people who are planning to buy a car but have no idea what they want, and no passion for any particular brand. They want you to purchase the best car, vacuum, laundry detergent, and tv for your money.

    It’s actually quite nice, you get a lot for the money. However… it`s the type of 4wd that`s really fwd most of the time, so unless you live in a snowy area, you`re paying for excess baggage most of the year. Knock down a couple of points for engine refinement, and the Civic has overall better interior room and trunk space. Classic case of the a smaller competitor competing on features against the larger market share fellow.

The one true reviewer I use when I buy a car is myself. I don’t care what the mags or websites say as they are written by someone I really don’t know or trust and often they are not an honest review as there is always some bribery involved.

We all have to realize likely half of car buyers are not buying a “car” but an appliance. Then many buy cars for other reasons…men buying pickups so they look rugged / parents who buy 7 passenger SUV to hide the fact that the real need is a minivan / image conscious wanting to look successful so they lease a $1k a month European car and park it on the street where it gets damaged.

Honda Civic – ok, this makes sense. The Focus is what the civic used to be: fun, efficient, status for young drivers. Civic is in Corolla territory these days ~ grandma wheels.

Dodge Grand Caravan – well you’d have to be an idiot to buy this over the Odyssey or Sienna if you didn’t have the extra $15k…ahh there’s the rub. People buy the Caravan on price, not because it’s the best, that ship sailed years ago.

Toyota Prius c – Not sure I understand the hate here. Doesn’t CR love the std. Prius? What is similar to the “c” that’s better?

Ford Edge V6 – Another one I don’t understand. Is the Murano somehow better? From what I’ve heard these have been quite reliable.

Jeep Liberty – The thing about Jeep is that they have their faithful and that’s that. For what 99.99999% of Liberty drivers do there is a better CUV out there, but “it’s a Jeep thing.” The Edge is probably a better pick, but it’s not “Trail Rated” for some imaginary trail that few if any Jeeps ever see.

    – Too many compromises for a relatively small price break compared to the standard Prius.

    I think you’ve made some very good points, I especially like the jibe about the imaginary trail few Jeeps see.

    But I find the comment about the Focus interesting, a Focus is status? When was a factory Civic ever ‘status’? You could make the argument having a new X is something to brag about when your 16 and getting your first set of wheels, but stripper econo-boxes of any brand do not status make… even if they now come with USB aux jacks, computers, and built in Facebook. If B and C segment cheaply built high priced rides are status then wow man, just wow… no wonder inspirational brands are suffering if people are content with entry level.

        28 Cars, I believe 200k is refering to the cacique of the Honda badge. Unlike you or I or anyone on TTAC, many people cannot tell the difference between their Civic DX with plastic wheel covers to the Civic Si; excepting maybe noting that the Si has ‘more stuff in it’. These are people who buy simply on brand recognition and can care less about the car itself.

My wife and I just bought a 2012 Impreza in february. We first drove the civic because I had one before. The impreza had much better brakes and the steering was more precise with better feel. The 5 door looks a little frumpy but it holds our scuba gear with 4 tanks and room to spare. Our best highway trip was 37.2 mpg which isnt too bad for all wheel drive. we didnt get navi but overall the interior is nice for an economy car with everything well placed. Just watch out for the red gauges at night, not the easiest to read at a glance. 187,000 people aren’t wrong, they just didnt notice Honda resting on its laurels and nobody told them.

In comparing the 2012 and 2009 Civics, I preferred the older one in looks (inside and out), materials, ride, and steering – essentially all the reasons CR doesn’t like the 2012.

Rather than spend more money for what I perceived to be shortcomings in the 2012, I bought the 2009, and couldn’t be happier. That’s not to say some people will prefer the 2012…I’m just not one of them.

The best reason not to hate on CR is that, unlike everyone else, they’re not on the “free trip to Spain” junket, “borrow a cool car for as long you like” gravy train.

CR takes a basically utilitarian perspective on cars: they have a function, and the question for CR is how well do they carry out that function, and at what price (defined to include repairs, purchase price, fuel, etc.)? Lately, CR seems to be a little less utilitarian in its outlook and makes some judgments about “fun-to-drive” etc.

CR’s priorities are known. If they are not yours, that doesn’t mean they’re wrong. Regarding the latest generation Civic, CR’s comments weren’t out of line with anyone else’s who evaluated the car. The fact that “it’s good enough for Grandma” means nothing, except that it’s not bad. Grandma didn’t shop all of the competition. IIRC, most reviewers said it was a mediocre car and, depending upon your priorities, competitive offerings from Chevy, Ford or Hyundai were better. The fact that the new Civic has sold a lot means two things: (1) the typical Civic buyer (not surprisingly) prioritizes reliability and Honda offers a better record on that than those other three competitors and (2) the strength of brand reputation. After all, for decades, Americans bought some truly execrable stuff made in Detroit in the 70s and 80s on the strength of reputations, some of the best targeted ads in the business and purchase price. Now, of course, all of that is catching up with Detroit in a big way, as there is a substantial segment of the population who would not be caught dead in a Detroit product.

Honda may well be like John Deere, in that JD sells a lot of crap at the box stores painted green and people assume they are getting a mower that will last like the old JD 318 did. Not gonna happen sparky, 2 different beasts here. And ask a couple lawn care guys how good those 800 series ZTR’s were. Finally, after Kubota ate their lunch in the small tractor market, Deere responded with a rushed to market turd with self-destructing front ends. Now, Deere finally figured it out but their rep is more than tarnished. I see a lot of Kubota, Massey, Case and New Holland tractors around than I do JD, unless it’s an OLD JD.

I once told a car salesman that reliability was the main factor in my purchase decision. He said that was admirable but for every person like me there were 99 worried about the placement of cup holders. I tend to agree, most people go by looks, image, how cool the interior is, that they are “Ford people”, etc. Just because it is popular doesn’t mean it is a good purchase choice.

My 76 year old mother just bought a 2012 Civic. (She was ripped off royally by the dealer, but that’s another story.) She didn’t care in the slightest that the car only has a 5-speed automatic. She wasn’t bothered by hard plastics. She didn’t care that some competitors are a couple seconds faster 0-60. She has been happy with her past Honda, and she liked the color. Moral: some sales you earn, and some are handed to you.
