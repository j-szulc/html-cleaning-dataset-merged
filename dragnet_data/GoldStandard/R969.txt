Please advise 

I think it's safe to assume that the advice reluctantly given in response to this wonderful memo, sent by record producer Teo Macero to executives at Columbia Records, was essentially, "Let Miles Davis call his next album whatever he wants." And rightly so. As we now know, the title stayed, and Bitches Brew was released to the public four months later. It is now considered one of the most influential jazz albums of all time.
