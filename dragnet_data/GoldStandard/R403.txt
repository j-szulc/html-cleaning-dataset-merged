Halloween Safety Game

When I asked everyone at The Notebook Gallery website if we could offer the Halloween Safety Game as a free download, the response was an overwhelming “YES!”

This is a fun activity that I put together to review basic Trick-or-Treating Safety Rules. To download, just sign up to The Notebook Gallery as a free member. There is no absolutely no obligation and you’ll find lots of free stuff as well.

If you like this activity, I hope you’ll take a closer look around The Notebook Gallery website and consider becoming a Premium Member (only $3.95* per month). While everyone at The Notebook Gallery still has to keep their day job, we’re having fun creating an invaluable resource for teachers who love SMART Boards and we have lots a new stuff coming in the weeks ahead. The 15% discount for Premium Membership expires soon!
