Hacker Monthly Breezed Past 2,000 Paid Subscribers
By Lim Cheng Soon, 10 November 2010
We've hit a tiny milestone - 2,000 paid subscribers (to be exact, it's 2,095 now and counting), for both print and digital subscription of the magazine. It's only been less than 3 months since we started offering the subscription plan, and we are incredibly happy that it works out so far.

Here's a huge thanks from me and the Hacker Monthly team - to the supportive readers and the awesome contributors. Thank you all. We will continue to pour our heart into it and hope you will keep enjoying the magazine.
