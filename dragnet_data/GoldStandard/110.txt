Actor Fred Willard is commenting online about his arrest for alleged lewd conduct at an adult movie theater in Hollywood, Calif., last Wednesday night, according to People.com.


Willard tweeted on Monday, "Wait til u hear my version; much more PG & my review, lousy film, but theater would make a terrific racquetball court. Full story 2 follow."

The 72-year-old actor was fired by PBS as the voice of "Market Warriors" after the alleged incident, but he remains host of the ABC improv show "Trust Us with Your Life."

He wrote, "I was not fired from "TUWYL," so B sure 2 watch."

The Los Angeles City District Attorney's Office announced on Friday that Willard will not be facing jail time in connection with his arrest on lewd conduct charges, and is eligible to enroll in a "pre-filing diversion program."
