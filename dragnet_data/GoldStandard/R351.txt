US elections: Turnout appears high in many parts of the country World, Updated Nov 07, 2012 at 02:56am IST


Washington: Turnout appears to be high in many parts of the country, with long waits at some polling places as voters deliver their Election Day verdict.

Both Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama need their supporters to show up in high numbers. A robust turnout among minorities would favor Obama, while Romney is looking for a strong showing among working-class white men.

Several storm-ravaged areas of New York and New Jersey and several swing states are reporting heavy turnout. The out reports were a relief for officials who feared Superstorm Sandy might keep people from the polls. 

More than 131 million people turned out to vote for president in 2008, shattering all previous records.

This year, more than 32 million people voted before Election Day, either by mail or in person.
