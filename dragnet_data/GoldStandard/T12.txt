Gymnast McKayla Maroney ‘Not Impressed’ MeMe – With Justin Bieber Photos

Posted by Shari August 9th, 2012 | 0 Comments »

McKaylaÂ Maroney is an amazing gymnast and one of the worldâ€™s best vaulters. When she fell during her vaulting performance at the Olympics and won silver she was clearly disappointed and not happy – at all.

Unfortunately, she wasn’t able to hide her disappointment and her feeling showed all over her face – for everyone to see and photograph. She apologized for her reaction to all of her twitter fans saying,

    Sportsmanship is so important to me and I hope you know i would never do that intentionally!! Please forgive me!!

It seems her expression has taken on a life of its own. Showing up with Justin Bieber, Channing Tatum, double rainbows, astronauts and many more. Let’s just say â€œMcKayla is not impressed.â€

We have a photo of McKayla showing how not impressed she is with Justin Bieber. Check it out.
