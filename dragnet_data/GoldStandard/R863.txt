NAKED JUDGING: The 2012 Canteen Awards in Photography

Canteen magazine is holding our second photography contest because of our general disdain for photography contests. They tend to be opaque affairs that stifle dialogue—the winners are chosen, no one quite knows why, and 99% of the participants are left without their entrance fee or an explanation. The real winners are the organizations1  that run and profit exorbitantly from them.

We are trying to do something different. Namely, treat our participants as partners. We aim to be fully transparent about the entire selection process, placing the judges’ criteria, biases, and disagreements on full, naked display. The result, we hope, will be an honest and provocative conversation about photography.

    Will make a change for sure. Just look at PDN. Neilson has realized just how much money they can make from competitions. One every issue now. So devalued.

    With social media, there’s an ongoing, relentless 24×7 “contest” by judges around the globe. So yeah, these side contests where you have to pay money are becoming devalued and irrelevant–why would your audience (or future audience) care what judges they’ve never heard of think?

    Want to start a photography contest that benefits photographers… Don’t do one. And if you’re already doing one, stop.

    And it’s also clear the next big money maker are “portfolio reviews”. Those are becoming a dime a dozen now and the photographers “best interests” are an after thought.
