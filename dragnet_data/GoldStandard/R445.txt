Here we have another shot of the HTC DROID DNA, the 5″ 1080p HTC device destined for Verizon. However, this shot is special: it’s high quality and clear and looks like an official press shot. It’s a good looking photo of a fairly good looking device.

If you look closely, the date on the widget says December 7th. Could this be a release date? We know that HTC and Verizon are hosting an event on the 13th of November, and it’s probably for this device. Could the release date be a whole month away? That sounds bad but is entirely possible. Or it might just be a random date, we really don’t know.
