In an interview with Martha Stewart, NPR gets her to teach the optimum way of removing pomegranate seeds. Stewart wouldn't stop someone from doing it the wrong way: "They will love me forever..because I have solved a lifelong problem." She goes onto to discuss Spam slathered with butter, her love of Velveeta cheese, and dating Hannibal Lector Anthony Hopkins. Naturally her date with Hopkins didn't last.
