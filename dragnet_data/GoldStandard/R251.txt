Point and Click Dictionary – pocket scanner delivers definitions on demand

The beauty of digital miniaturization is you can fit huge amounts of information into very tiny spaces. In the old days we had to carry around massive reference books if we wanted to keep up with our learning and supplement our brain-power. Then along came them there micro-processors and everything changed.

Today, we can stay smart by using something like this Point and Click Dictionary, which although it’s no bigger than a pack of cards, can serve up 500,000 word definitions and offer four different language translations as well. Hey, not only that, but it doubles up as an MP3 player and voice recorder and instead of typing everything in, you just point the integrated camera scanner at the page and it does the definition work automatically.

Just to freak us out a little more, it comes with an internal speaker through which you can hear the pronunciation of the words loud and clear. Definitions come from the Collins English Dictionary and there’s a stylus included which you can use on the 2.4 inch color touchscreen. Priced at $279.95.
