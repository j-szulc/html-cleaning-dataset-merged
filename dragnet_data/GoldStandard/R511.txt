NFL fantasy football: Darren Sproles out with hand injury

News comes this afternoon that New Orleans Saints running back (and general PPR dynamo) Darren Sproles is out for Monday night’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles after having surgery on his broken hand. Saints coach Joe Vitt told reporters that he wasn’t sure when Sproles would return and that the back would be evaluated again next week, comparing the injury to an opera singer with a sore throat.

Before all of you Mark Ingram fantasy owners get any ideas, the player who stands to gain the most is Pierre Thomas. Sproles’ biggest impact was in the passing game, where he has 39 receptions, second only to Marques Colston. That’s not Ingram’s strength. This season, he has just one catch for minus-one yards while last year he logged just 11 catches for 46 yards. Thomas isn’t renowned for his pass-catching ability, but he’s more proficient in that area than Ingram is and will likely see more snaps because of it.
