What's the Latest Development?

Contributing to the ever-growing collection of robots designed to mimic animal behavior is Atlanta-based TechJect, which has created a small, unmanned aerial vehicle that looks and behaves like a dragonfly. With five technology design patents, their robot (which is named Dragonfly) comes standard with "stereoscopic vision, flight control systems and a camera-ready operating system"; customized options can be ordered depending on what the buyer wants it to do. Applications for the highly modular device range from gaming to aerial photography to spying on your neighbor.

What's the Big Idea?

TechJect began as a spinoff from Georgia Tech's robotics department. Perhaps not surprisingly, its Dragonfly project initially received $1 million in funds from the US Air Force. Over time, the prototypes became smaller, and now, according to the TechJect site, "you can take it in your pocket wherever you go." Currently the company has an Indiegogo campaign going in which it hopes to raise enough money to allow it to put the Dragonfly on the market in 2013, with prices ranging from $100 to $500.
