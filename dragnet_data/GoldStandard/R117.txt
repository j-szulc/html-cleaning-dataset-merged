The Simple Tip For Matching Your Lipstick to Your Dress 

Wearing a beautifully beaded coral dress and a seriously tousled chignon, Kerry Washington dazzled at the LACMA 2012 Art + Film Gala over the weekend. Her makeup was equally glamorous, with the actress opting for a metallic smoky eye and spindly long lashes. But it was Kerry's coral lipstick, perfectly matched to her dress, that had us buzzing. When done well, matchy-matchy makeup can look pretty instead of tacky. To avoid the latter, make sure to pick a shade that's within one to two shades of your outfit's color instead of opting for the exact shade of your frock. Kerry's coral is a touch lighter than the opaque shade of her dress, so it doesn't look overdone. Getting a little match-happy never looked so good.
