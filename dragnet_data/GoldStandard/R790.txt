Opinionated chef Claude Bosi of two Michelin star Hibiscus launched a tirade against his fellow French countrymen, calling them "unimaginative in the kitchen." The two-Michelin starred chef grew up in Lyon but moved to England 15 years later, moving up in the culinary world starting at Alain Ducasse's London outpost. Bosi calls France, "a country of lazy people. A very lazy country. They live in the past and just live on their reputations." The chef has embraced British pub culture and plans to open at least six more pubs in the near future. [Telegraph]
