        Originally Published on Thursday, December 15, 2011: Timeline gives you an easy way to see the things you've shared, and collect all your best moments in a single place. In addition to making timeline available on the web , today we're also launching timeline on Android and m.facebook.com.

         

        	
        	

                          

        Mobile timeline starts with your unique cover photo. As you scroll down, you'll see your posts, photos and life events as they happened, back to the day you were born. Photo albums and other posts are horizontally swipeable, so you can quickly view multiple photos or posts inline without leaving timeline. You can also swipe through the views at the top of your timeline to navigate to your map, photos, subscribers and more.

         

        Making stories more visual

        Your posts now appear in several different ways on your mobile timeline. The photos you share are bigger, and friends you're with and places you visit appear on a map.
