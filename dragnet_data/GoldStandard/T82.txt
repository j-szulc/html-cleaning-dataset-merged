Mitsubishi "temporarily suspends" making electric Peugeot Ion, Citroen C-Zero

Despite some popular deals available for limited times and long-distance adventures, the Citroen C-Zero and Peugeot Ion were never big sellers. Now, Mitsubishi has decided that it's not worth it to build the electric vehicles for PSA any more.

Automotive News reports that overall slow sales of the two electric cars – for the first half of 2012, 852 Ions and 935 C-Zeros were sold – mean an indefinite hiatus for the European jellybeans. A Mitsubishi representative told AN that, "This is a matter of PSA adjusting its orders to market demand. ... Our production total is lower than what we had originally hoped for." The Ion and C-Zero are both rebadged versions of the i-MiEV that Mitsubishi makes in Japan.

Christine Jew, senior specialist, product communications, for Mitsubishi Motors North America, told AutoblogGreen that, "Yes, supply to PSA has been temporarily suspended, however production and sales of i-MiEVs around the world continues as usual. Therefore, this does not affect U.S. production of the i-MiEV."

The i-MiEV is a bomb. People just don't want to pay a large amount of money for an ugly car with a short range. Hopefully a better looking car would do a little better . . . but Leaf shows that even a better looking car still won't do well.

EVs are stuck in a 'valley of death' . . . they have been unable to reduce battery prices and gas prices have dropped. Thus, there is not much of a value proposition to EVs at the moment. Tough times.

Oh dear.
They are not shifting even with France's 7,000 Euro credit at the point of sale, which is around $10,000 US.
