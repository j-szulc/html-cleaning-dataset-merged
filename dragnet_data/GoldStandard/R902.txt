Fraser Valley Bald Eagle Festival 2012
November 12th, 2012 @ 2:14pm (PT) by Rebecca Bollwitt

The Fraser Valley Bald Eagle Festival is happening over the next four weekends around the scenic Harrison. Surrounded by mountains, glacier-fed rivers, and valley pastures, the bald eagle festival is a great time to explore the region while witnessing the world’s largest gathering of these magnificent birds.


    November 17th to 18th, 2012: Launch and Main Event in Harrison Mills & Chehalis
    November 23rd to 25th, 2012: Featured Region: Harrison Hot Springs
    November 30th to 2nd, 2012: Featured Region: Harrison Mills
    December 9th to 10th, 2012: Featured Region: Harrison Mills

Stop in at the Mission Chamber of Commerce on your way to the Inch Creek Hatchery or visit the Kilby Historic Site for exhibitor talks then watch for eagles at the estuary via Tapadra Estates. Each weekend will have and information centre, suggested spots for eagle viewing, and featured locations for exhibits, talks and activities.

You can also book a boat tour in advance out of Harrison Hot Springs. John and I did a Harrison and Fraser River eco-tour by boat one year and it was very informative. We loved exploring the beautiful region from the water and although we didn’t spot any eagles at the time (it was in July) we did see Osprey.
