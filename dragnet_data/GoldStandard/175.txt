Georgia authorities are searching for a toddler's grandmother and her boyfriend after the 13-month-old was found to have ingested cocaine.

 The toddler's mom brought him to Piedmont Newnan Hospital on Saturday, near his grandmother's Palmetto, Ga., home. He was transferred and admitted to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, where doctors confirmed he had cocaine in his system, Palmetto Police Sgt. Lee Gragg told NBC News.

Police were told the boy, whose name was not released, ingested the cocaine at the home where his grandmother lives with her boyfriend. Warrants for Ebony Daniel, 34, and her boyfriend, Charlie Martin, 22, were issued Monday.


Police have not had any contact with Daniel, but on Tuesday, Martin called the police sergeant.

"He called me and stated he wished to turn himself in, but as of yet, that has not happened," Gragg said Tuesday afternoon. "I told him that was good, it'd work out best for him and everyone else if he did that."

Martin did not provide any information on the whereabouts of his girlfriend, the toddler's grandmother.

The toddler's 17-year-old mother is considered a witness and hasn't been charged, Gragg said.

Toxicology reports to determine how much cocaine the boy ingested have not been returned yet, but the child had been released from the hospital after spending two nights there, investigators said Monday. He is expected to survive.

Police searched Daniel and Martin's apartment Saturday, trying to piece together what happened.

"According to witnesses, the cocaine was open and available on a table inside the house," Gragg said.

Daniel and Martin face charges of possession of cocaine, cruelty to children in the first degree, and reckless conduct, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
