Swap 'til You Drop on Once Loved Laundry
Star-studded secondhand goods

They say a picture’s worth a thousand words. But you love a good backstory.

Like the one behind new shopping site Once Loved Laundry.

Model-turned-stylist and founder Jessica Malafouris enlists fashion industry friends for regular posts to an immaculately curated, Tumblr-based shop that’s equal parts home tour and intimate retail experience.

Connect with design mainstays (Rogan Gregory, Mara Hoffman) and under-the-radar insiders (stylist Sofia Karvela) via Malafouris’s close-up lens and their gently used, one-of-a-kind clothing.

Malafouris keeps tours rolling with an ever-changing, always-original Proust Questionnaire (provided Proust had to answer unexpected questions such as “Best swearword ever?” and “What would you do if someone left a bag of shit on your doorstep?”).

But enough with the dirty details.

Available at oncelovedlaundry.com, $20-$500.
