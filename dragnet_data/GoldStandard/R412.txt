NEW YORK -- Negotiations between the National Hockey League and National Hockey League Players' Association toward a new Collective Bargaining Agreement have resumed Tuesday afternoon at an undisclosed location in New York City.

In a media briefing prior to the meeting, NHLPA Executive Director Donald Fehr said the agenda will focus on the "issues which divide us."

According to NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly, to avoid disrupting the process the NHL will wait until the talks conclude to address the media.

Daly and NHLPA Special Counsel Steve Fehr met at a private location for several hours Saturday and both reported a desire to continue the meetings this week.

Saturday's meeting was the first face-to-face session between the two sides since Oct. 18 in Toronto.

The NHL and NHLPA have been without a CBA since Sept. 15.
