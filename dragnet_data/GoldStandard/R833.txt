Magic School Bus: The Movie

Unfortunately, this isn’t a real trailer – it’s a fan-made dream. But how awesome would it be if they actually did a remake of The Magic School Bus (minus some of the terrible acting). Please let this be a normal field trip. With Miss Frizzle? No way!

They should also just hurry up and make a Captain Planet movie already, right!?

What was your favourite The Magic School Bus episode? I loved the one where they went inside the human body. That was fun.

Mine was the sapce one, when the School Bus mimicked the USS enterprise :)

I'm a star wars fan though I'd loved a death star/millenium falcon reference

Yet again, this is why I hate these shorts, cause they're freaking awesome, and we'll (probably) never see anything more come from it. That said, this is one of the ones I really, really hope to see something more.
