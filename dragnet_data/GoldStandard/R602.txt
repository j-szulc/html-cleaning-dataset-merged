The End of the Libraries and Transliteracy Blog
October 10, 2012
By Bobbi Newman

The team over at Libraries and Transliteracy recent came to the decision that it was time to end the project. When we launched the project the purpose was to bring attention to transliteracy in all types of libraries and we worked hard to include contributors from public, academic, and school libraries (and other types with less success) with a diverse background. Over the last couple of years we have seen conversation and heated debates around the concept. We have seen transliteracy included in job titles and job descriptions, there have been whole conferences devoted to the subject for public, academic, and school librarians, and the term and ideas are included in grant proposals and other works. As hard as it is to decide the end the project we can certainly say that we have achieved our goals. Myself, and others, will be continuing to work on the subject but the time has come to end the group project. The site will remain up as a resource.

It has been a true honor working with the team at L&T over the last couple of years. Thank you to everyone for their hard work and support. I know it is the right thing to do but it is hard to let it go. Thank you to everyone who has supported us over the years.
