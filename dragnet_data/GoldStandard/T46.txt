Turns out Dirk Nowitzki did get married to fiance Jessica Olsson in July. Despite recent denials by the Mavericks’ organization, dallasnews.com’s Robert Wilonsky got the official word from State District Judge Craig Smith, who performed the ceremony on July 20 at Dirk’s Preston Hollow home.

Only a handful of close friends attended the ceremony. No word if Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard got an invite.

But if you could give Dirk a wedding gift, what would it be?

Howard in a Mavericks uniform sounds like a good plate to start, though Jessica might have other ideas.
