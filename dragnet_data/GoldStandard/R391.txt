vSphere SRM 5.1 - Recoverpoint SRA passes the cert

Just got the internal word – was pushing for this hard when I was in Israel a week back, and glad to see it out…

(thank you to the Recoverpoint team!)

    “Just got the word from VMware that the SRM 5.1 RP adapter is certified and VMware will update their db by Friday.

    Note that for now only the 'fc' cert was completed, the 'iscsi' one will follow in November. This is expected to be a formality only, the exact same adapter will be re-certified in an iscsi-only env (no san switches, RP is directly attached to VNX).


    To avoid any doubt, iscsi hosts connected to VNXs, and RP connected through FC, is part of what has just been certified.”

Normally I wouldn’t air this out (I would wait a little longer) – frankly customers should always use the VMware support site for SRAs as the final word – but know that there are more than a few customers eagerly awaiting this…

Psst… I know that many of you have been asking for the “point-in-time” recovery model of Recoverpoint to work with SRM.  The VMware SRM APIs cause a “lowest common denominator” effect – dumbing down something unique like Recoverpoint… But, we’ve found a creative answer.  Stay tuned – working on it.
