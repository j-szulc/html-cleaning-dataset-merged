Williams Mullen Adds New Top Lobbyist in D.C. Office

Williams Mullen’s government relations practice has grown with the addition of a new top lobbyist in Washington.

Matt LaRocco joins Williams Mullen as the firm's director of government affairs. Previously, LaRocco, who is not an attorney, was with Arnold & Porter as a registered lobbyist and public affairs strategist.

LaRocco has eleven years of lobbying experience in the areas of transportation, defense, homeland security, financial services and education.

At Arnold & Porter, LaRocco was a senior legislative and policy adviser. He also served as a board member on the Richmond, Va.-based firm's political action committee.

Williams Mullen partner Chip Nottingham, who was involved in the process of hiring LaRocco, said they chose him based on his excellent reputation. He added that the clients LaRocco brings with him are particularly helpful to the firm.

Prior to Arnold & Porter, LaRocco worked for Fleishman-Hillard Government Relations. During the Clinton administration, he worked as a special assistant to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.

“Matt LaRocco has tremendous experience over many years working in the Clinton administration at the Department of Interior, working for multiple large and well known government relations firms, and we were delighted to add his capabilities and experience to our team,” Nottingham said.

LaRocco could not be reached for comment.
