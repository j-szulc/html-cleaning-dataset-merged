Labour, you've made your point about the EU – now make the case for it

In tough times it is only right that the EU budget be trimmed, but the left must never forget the benefits of membership

Politics is often a rough trade, everyone knows it and the public despises its practitioners for it. It was ever thus, back to ancient Greece and Rome. Whenever two people form a party they must compromise; the bigger the party, the nearer to power, the more compromises are required. MPs of all parties are whipped through lobbies to vote for things that make them queasy.

So it was on Wednesday night that a mournful cadre of Labour MPs found themselves voting with a rabble of 53 Tory Europhobics for whom cutting the EU budget was another triumphant step towards EU exit. Liberal Democrats could, for once, claim the moral high ground as they strode off to vote, as usual, with David Cameron. Labour MPs found themselves ribbed and ridiculed by their new friends, with "Welcome on board!" and "Glad we've converted you!" from the likes of Mark Reckless, Douglas Carswell and Bernard Jenkin. Not surprisingly, some Labour MPs looked hang-dog after they had sat through speeches such as theirs.

Tory rebel Mark Pritchard has said, while "brave forces are spilling their blood in Afghanistan … are we going to continue to ask families throughout this country to stop putting new shoes on their children's feet in order to pay for the very large Mercedes fleet in Brussels?" Sammy Wilson of the DUP denounced the "arrogance" of "the Bisto bureaucrats who think that the gravy train is still running". Bill Cash said: "They are saying, 'We are going to go off and have a federal Europe.' Well, let them have it!" Many of these ultra-rightists who called out for "More, more!" when George Osborne cut state spending, now wept crocodile tears contrasting the plight of shoeless children at home with "an obese Brussels that needs to go on a diet like everyone else".

Labour stands accused of "rank opportunism". John Smith did the same over Maastricht: oppositions rarely miss an exceptional chance to defeat the government of the day. But there was special relish on this occasion: Cameron and his party deserved to be devoured by the Eurosceptic monster they created. William Hague's 2001 battle cry that Britain was turning into "a foreign land" has led to the selection of more extreme Tory MPs ever since, the entire party infected with the Euro-virus. Why should Labour rescue them from themselves?

The symbolism of Labour running with the Europhobic pack was excruciating, but what matters most is the substance of the issue itself. Labour's motives may be mixed – but nonetheless they are on the right side on this. The people of Europe enduring the hardest of times cannot let the EU keep the only protected budget: a public vote across all 27 nations would surely want a cut. Brussels risks looking even more remote if it fails to respond to people's suffering by cutting its own cloth. Labour may be populist, but public opinion is dead right on this.

To be a strong pro-European has never meant supporting whatever Brussels does. Few can justify the extravagant parliament travelling between Brussels and Strasbourg. There is no need for 27 commissioners, each with their own cabinet. Even the reformed common agricultural policy still pays most cash to the wrong farmers – the Queen and big landowners. Every organisation, public or private, needs constant vigilance over its accounts. Finding waste in Whitehall or Brussels is only a good excuse for demolishing those institutions to those ideologues who want to do that anyway.

There is one far more serious charge: the EU's economic austerity has become a "death spiral of deficit cutting", according to Jonathan Portes of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which this week computed the total impact on growth sucked out of the 27. This is a gigantic failure of its first great economic test. However, that's the one charge against the EU these Tories would never make.

The cost of membership is not high: we pay a net 1% of GDP, the same as France, 85% of it redistributed to poorer countries. What we get back in trade is far greater: let's hope we never get the chance to measure exactly what we lose in cash, influence and trade if we quit. Emma Reynolds, Labour's shadow Europe minister, who worked in Brussels and for Robin Cook before returning to her native Wolverhampton as MP, has no trouble spelling out to her constituents the trading benefits to Jaguar Rover and the aerospace industries where many work. This multilingual pro-European MP plainly enjoyed Wednesday's vote no more than the rest – but how could she look her city in the eye while it faces 30% cuts, with low to middle incomes stagnated for years past and years to come, according to the Resolution Foundation report this week?

Telephones were buzzing today with the shadow cabinet calling every pro-European to impress on them their deep pro-EU credentials. I've been inundated with old articles, speeches and pamphlets dusted down and emailed to prove their various authors' eternal Europhilia. The truth is that there would be little embarrassment over this week's vote if indeed Labour had been roundly supporting the European idea over all the Blair-Brown years.

But the state of national opinion bears witness to their lack of any attempt to make the pro-Europe case – except for the tireless former Europe minister Denis MacShane. Tony Blair, a French speaker and committed European, wrote a shameless "no surrender" article in the Sun to appease Murdoch on the eve of the 1997 election. He never made speeches at home to explain the value of membership. Every Brussels meeting was a "fight" to defend "British red lines". So any Blairites incensed by this week's vote might pause to consider that British anti-Europeanism is also his legacy. Brown was even less inclined to challenge attitudes pumped out by our 80% Europhobic press.

That pusillanimous record, along with Labour's vote this week, puts a heavy onus on both Eds and all the shadow cabinet to start speaking out for Britain's membership. Today I spoke to several who were earnestly pledging that they would. A referendum hangs in the air, though it looks unlikely other countries want any treaty that risks triggering one in any country. Lib Dem and Tory manifestos in 2015 will carry some referendum pledge. If Labour is obliged to offer one too, then it had better start making an earnest pro-European case at every opportunity from now on.

    The UK should be proud of its EU membership, the benefits being a part of it are vast. Its emphasis on corporation and peace are its most admired principles. The free movement of works, free movement of goods are both great ideas that a lot of places on Earth can only dream of.

    Contrary to what its critics would say, the UK needs the EU. Only by being part of the greater EU community will the UK be able to compete on the global market in the future.

        Why should Labour rescue them from themselves?

    Well what do Labour stand for? Because if they're pro-EU they've made it a hell of a lot harder for themselves when the inevitable referendum takes place because they've given the right-wing Tories ammunition. If they are genuinely against the EU then they'll lose the backing of most businesses. Remember Norway is the most enthusiastic adopter of EU legislation. Better to be inside the the tent peeing out than outside peeing in.

        The symbolism of Labour running with the Europhobic pack was excruciating, but what matters most is the substance of the issue itself. Labour's motives may be mixed – but nonetheless they are on the right side on this. The people of Europe enduring the hardest of times cannot let the EU keep the only protected budget: a public vote across all 27 nations would surely want a cut. Brussels risks looking even more remote if it fails to respond to people's suffering by cutting its own cloth. Labour may be populist, but public opinion is dead right on this.

    So in economically troubling times, budgets should be cut?

        To be a strong pro-European has never meant supporting whatever Brussels does

    No it hasn't. But considering what you've written before, it sounds very much like the UKIP commentators of the Daily Telegraph website, as a 'get-out clause'

        The cost of membership is not high: we pay a net 1% of GDP, the same as France, 85% of it redistributed to poorer countries. What we get back in trade is far greater: let's hope we never get the chance to measure exactly what we lose in cash, influence and trade if we quit.

    Agreed. While I disagree with most of your economic views I am staunchly pro-EU. But the shift rightwards in the debate is troubling and it has been enabled by the Labour party - or, should I say, Ed Balls.

        If Labour is obliged to offer one too, then it had better start making an earnest pro-European case at every opportunity from now on.

    But how can it do that? It's just ascribed itself to a populist policy. What next, supporting capital punishment? How can they just change their policies to curry whatever political failure is going? And won't any pro-European sounds from Labour sound hollow in light of their actions. I was beginning to think the Labour party might have had a decent policy or 2. Now I don't think so.

    The left wing case for the EU all too often rests on the principle that the Tories are against it so we must be for it. A cursory glance at the EU in full marketisation and troika mode, coupled with the democratic deficit, reveals that it is not a left wing institution. It is possible for the left and the right to both criticise the EU and even vote the same way at times for different reasons.

    Without that "Eurosceptic monster" the Conservatives would have been on the wrong side of the biggest domestic political issue of the last 25 years- the single currency- just as Labour, the Lib Dems, the Guardian and Polly Toynbee were.

        The free movement of works is a great idea that a lot of places on Earth can only dream of

    I am assuming you mean free movement of people here. As the Lords Report into the economic impact of immigration stated in 2008, this has a negative impact on wage levels for low earners.

    So for low earners, it is not a great idea which they could only dream of, it is a waking nightmare of low wages

    The Labour party will always be rank opportunists whilst they have no policies to speak of.

    Being against the Tories on everything as a policy is symptomatic of the clueless leadership the party now has.

    Their one hope for the next election is that the Tories are voted out of office rather than the Labour party voted in. It's not a clever strategy when people can remember the shamble of the Blair/Brown years.

    As for Europe. Miliband wouldn't have the nerve to leave. Neither Blair nor Brown stood up for the country, Blair gave away billions of our rebate for nothing in return.

    It's strange that the Labour party grow some balls only when in opposition.

    Not if they want to win, they won't.

    You can't be at the centre of EU affairs anymore without joining the Euro, and the Euro won't work in the long term without federalism.

    The British people don't want the Euro. And we don't want Eurofederalism either.

    Whether we move away from the centre of EU affairs, or they move on from us, or most likely both things happen at the same time, there is no longer any mileage in cheerleading for the Project. The real conversation we need to be having is how we are going to relate to the emerging Eurozone Federation from the outside - assuming that the common currency stays intact for long enough for such a thing to form, of course.

    Ms Toynbee thinks the most acute issue that should be addressed today in the EU is the "death spiral of deficit cutting" and then presents her case in an article arguing for cuts to the EU budget. Sadly, this is as coherent as British thinking on Europe gets.

    Ms Toynbee is right that public opinion in 27 EU member states would applaud any cuts to the EU budget. However, I would expect her to also take seriously the public opinion in the UK and demand a referendum on British EU membership. Sadly, this is as coherent as British thinking on Europe gets.

    The left (well if Labour still occupies that position) must never forget that before Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson, that they were proudly Eurosceptic and actively campaigned for withdrawal.

    I wish people would remember this and stop saying it's just about splits in the right. Labour at its very best and most free was when it was Eurosceptic. The vast majority of traditional Labour voters want a referendum. I just hope the vote yesterday signals a new page and the party discredits Tony Blair's pro-EU bile. Leave it to Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems to keep supporting that undemocratic gravy train.

    As Polly Toynbee says

        To be a strong pro-European has never meant supporting whatever Brussels does.

    All the same most pro-Europeans will have felt discomfort at Labour's decision to support the right-wing Tory rebellion against David Cameron.

    I would have felt less uncomfortable about this had Labour been making a strong and clear case for Europe (which would include proposals to change it for the better). The problem is they Labour leaders have not been doing that. It is a topic they would rather not talk about. That won't do and ultimately, if things remain like this, it will confirm the idea that supporting a Parliamentary motion calling for a reduction in the EU budget was an act of cynical opportunism.

        That pusillanimous record, along with Labour's vote this week, puts a heavy onus on both Eds and all the shadow cabinet to start speaking out for Britain's membership.
