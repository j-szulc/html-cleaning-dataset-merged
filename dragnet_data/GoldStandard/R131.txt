New Crisis Response maps feature preparedness information for Hurricane Sandy
Sunday, October 28, 2012 at 12:48 PM

Already responsible for a reported 41 deaths across the Caribbean, late-season Hurricane Sandy is expected to make landfall again early this week on the East Coast of the United States.

Some are calling the hurricane “Frankenstorm” due to its potential mix of both winter and tropical cyclone weather. Regardless of what you call it, we hope that you get the information you need to make preparations and stay safe if you are in the area. It has the potential to be one of the worst storms the area has seen in decades.

The Google Crisis Response team has assembled a Hurricane Sandy map to help you track the storm’s progress and provide updated emergency information.

On the map, you’ll find the following emergency preparedness information:

    Location tracking, including the hurricane’s current and forecasted paths, courtesy of the NOAA-National Hurricane Center
    Public alerts, including evacuation notices, storm warnings, and more, via weather.gov and earthquake.usgs.gov
    Radar and cloud imagery from weather.com and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory
    Evacuation information and routes
    Shelters and recovery centers will appear as they become operational
    Storm footage and storm-related YouTube videos, curated by Storyful

We’ve also launched a map specific to New York City, featuring evacuation zone information from NYC Open Data, open shelters, weather information and live webcams.

You can easily share and embed these maps on your website — just hit the “Share” button at the top of the map to get the HTML code. We’ll continue to update these maps as more information becomes available.
