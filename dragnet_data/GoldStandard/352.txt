A Faster Facebook for Android
by Keith Peiris on Wednesday, December 7, 2011 at 11:30am

Today we're launching an updated Facebook app for Android. It's now quicker and easier to view photos, get messages and navigate around the app.

 

Photos get better

Photos and albums are up to two times faster than the previous Android app. It's also easier to share photos, view comments and edit captions on the go.

 
Messages on top

Your messages and notifications are now at the top of your screen. You can respond to friends and stay updated without leaving the page you're on.
 

Menu on the side

You can quickly access your News Feed, Groups, games and apps from the new left-hand menu. The features you use most are now at your fingertips.

 

Get the App

Facebook for Android is available on Android Market.  We're excited about the new app, and we hope you check it out.
