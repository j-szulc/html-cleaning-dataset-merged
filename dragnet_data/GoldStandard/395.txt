Listen to Music With Your Friends
by Alexandre Roche on Thursday, January 12, 2012 at 10:00am

Music is one of the most powerful and fun ways to connect. Whether it's at a concert with a bunch of people or on a long car ride with your best buddy, we love listening to music with our friends. But what if you could listen to music with your friends when you're alone, like at work, at home or on the go?

 

Today, with music services on Facebook, there's a new way to listen with friends. This feature lets you listen along with any of your friends who are currently listening to music. You can also listen together in a group while one of your friends plays DJ.  

 

You can listen to the same song, at the exact same timeâ€”so when your favorite vocal part comes in you can experience it together, just like when you're jamming out at a performance or dance club.

 

How It Works

 

Look for the music note in the chat sidebar to see which of your friends are listening to music. To listen with a friend, hover over their name, and click the Listen With button. The music will play through the service your friend is using.

 

When a new song plays, you'll come along for the ride, discovering new music while your friend DJs for you.

 

 

You'll also have the option to chat about what you're listening to.  As other people start listening along, they'll join the party in a group chat.

 

 

You can control who you're listening along with through your settings. Learn more here.

 

Rollout Starts Today

 

Now, you can experience enjoying music together with your friends no matter where you are. This feature will start rolling out over the next few weeks. We hope you enjoy listening with friends!
