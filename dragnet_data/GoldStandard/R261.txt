Time Vampire by Another Safe Landing	11Oct12

I have just started reading the first of the Artimis Fowl books about a time traveling teenager and it’s good. The first few pages describe a world that while fantastic is instantly plausible (to sci fi nerds) and seems quite wholly formed in a few short pages.

I guess that’s why I liked this flava flav time vampire of sorts from Another Safe Landing. Although I think Vampires are like time travellers anyway aren’t they? As immortals they live outside the flow of time experienced by us mere mortals although they are trapped by the same sequential flow? Time travel is a lovely mind bender. What’s your favorite time travel story?
