Microsoft BUILD 2012 Day 1 keynote (in pictures)

It’s day 1 of Microsoft’s BUILD 2012 developer conference and to kick things off with a bang was the first of two keynotes held in the “big tent” seating around 2,000 attendees.

Steve Ballmer came out on stage and spoke for a large majority of the 2-hour presentation, recapping launches and market numbers as well as demonstrating a number of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 devices and features. This was followed by a number of technology and partner presentations.

Last but not least, attendees roared in excitement as Steve Ballmer and Richard Kerris from Nokia announced that every person would be receiving a free Microsoft Surface RT and Nokia Lumia 920 Windows Phone 8 device to take home.

Looks like a good chunk of what would have once been presented at CES (“device porn”) was transported to Build. Not exactly what you’d expect for a developer conference.
