The Dorkly Weekly: Oh Come On, Everybody Loves Mortal Kombatâ€™s Toasty Guy
Mike Fahey	
Don't be like that, Dorkly! Dan Forden sounds like a great guy to hang out at T.G.I. Friday's with on a Monday.


Dan Forden, one of the four programmers that initially began working on the original Mortal Kombat, along with Ed Boon, John Tobias and John Vogel, is better known to the world at large as the Toasty Guy. He was the sound guy for the game, so it makes perfect sense that his dulcet tones show up to salute a particularly brutal maneuver.

Or a great deal on appetizers.
