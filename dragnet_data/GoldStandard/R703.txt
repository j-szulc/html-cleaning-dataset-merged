Rustic Wedding in Napa

How beautiful is this rustic wedding inspiration shoot? I love the bold color of all the orange details up against the natural backdrop of Napa Valley. It’s a really nice mix of colorful and organic. Below are more details from the designer, Tracy Taylor Ward…

I wanted to submit an inspiration shoot I produced in Napa, shot by my friend and colleague Scott Andrew Studio this past July. The purpose of the shoot was to show how a European destination wedding, which might be way out of budget for many people, could be achieved in the United States and even locally for Northern California residents.
