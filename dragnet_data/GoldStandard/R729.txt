AT CARVEN – PARIS

Leave it to Carven to attract the cutest french girls, like lovely Ana Girardot. There is something incredible about this dress, first of all the fabric is unusual and different. Then there is the cut which is a very well done baby doll cut. I have been over the baby doll cut for quite some time but seeing it done so immaculate and structured I suddenly remember why it’s so good.

    Stunning photo! And I need that dress. I don’t like babydoll at all, but this is different.

    I love this shot! Please never stop blogging, you’re so inspiring. Your point of view is really the sharpest in the industry. I’m so over ‘statement necklaces’ and that gang.

    I also think that there is a mutual attraction. The girl makes this dress look so good as well as the dress makes her look lovely
