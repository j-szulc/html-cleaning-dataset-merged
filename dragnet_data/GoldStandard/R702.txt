Fishtail Bun Wedding Hair Tutorial

Here’s a super lovely wedding hair tutorial we found on Pinterest…its really easy and simple.

Instructions

1) It looks like you want to start with some texture in your hair so go ahead and use some product and curl it up a little. You might want to back comb and tease it up some at the crown and in the back to add some more volume there, too. Then do a fishtail braid. This one is done to the side but it could also be done in the middle.

2) Then pull the braid so it loose and wide.

3)Twist it into a bun and secure with pins. So pretty!
