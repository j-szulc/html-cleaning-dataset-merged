Macbeth Inspired T-Shirt from the Affair	22Oct12

This is a pretty cool Macbeth inspired T-Shirt from the Affair. In theatrical circles it is referred to as “The Scottish Play” in due to its reputation for bringing bad luck. It was even rumoured that Shakespeares own Globe Theatre burned down after a production of Macbeth, although it turned out to be during a production of Henry VIII. It is considered Shakespeares darkest play and certainly his bloodiest.

    By the pricking of my thumbs,
    Something wicked this way comes.
