PayPal Lays Off 325 Employees

By KRISTIN JONES

EBay Inc.'s PayPal payments business has laid off 325 employees, and is ending contracts with another 120 contractors as it revamps its product development efforts.

The company expects to record a fourth-quarter pretax charge of $15 million in connection with the job cuts, which are primarily affecting its product and technology organizations.

EBay executives said earlier this month that it planned to streamline its PayPal business, but didn't clarify at the time whether the initiative would involve layoffs.

The company's payments unit, which is mostly made up of the PayPal business, posted 23% growth in revenue for the third quarter, to nearly $1.4 billion.
