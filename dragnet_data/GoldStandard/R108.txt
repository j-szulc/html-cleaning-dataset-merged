    The Future of C++

    Friday, November 2, 2012
    12:45pm (U.S. Pacific Time)

    This talk will give an update on recent progress and near-future directions for C++, both at Microsoft and across the industry, with some announcements of interest in both areas. The speaker is the lead language architect of Visual C++ and chair of the ISO C++ committee.

The talk will be webcast live, and available soon afterwards on demand.

If you know people who are interested in C++, on any platform, youâ€™ll want to let them know to tune in.
