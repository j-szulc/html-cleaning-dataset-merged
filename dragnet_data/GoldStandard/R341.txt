Rhapsody for Android updated with personalized recommendations

    
Rhapsody's subscription-based music app for Android has been updated with personalized recommendations on the home screen based on what you've previously listened to and what time of day it is. That last part is very reminiscent of what Songza's offering, though the update also includes a UI overhaul, and some performance improvements for offline playback. 

As always, Rhapsody offers the usual streaming music features, including creating playslists, sharing tunes out to Facebook, and offline caching.

Any Rhapsody subscribers out there, or are the existing free streaming alternatives good enough for you? What's your favorite on-demand mobile music app?

I use Spotify premium, and personally don't see a need for anything else unless you don't want to pay the $10 per month.

I use Rhapsody all of the time, mostly because I can stream it to my phone, PC, and even download tracks/albums to my mp3 player on a monthly license. Since I don't have the luxury of being able to access my cell while I'm at work, the mp3 player option is an absolute must!

Rhapsody has definitely stepped up their App game past year. Love my Rhapsody! Put 30hours of music on my GS3 plus can still listen to what ever I am in the mood for within cell or WiFi range. Best music service bar none.
