    So true! After Facebook and Twitter, people can’t get enough to Instagram as well as Pinterest.The power of social media…

    That is awesome. I love the graphics too. We use Instragram for our 1001 Bottles project. We take the same style of shot and use the same filter for all bottles. One day, when we are done with the list, we will have 1001 images (plus additional images that are not a part of the list) there for viewing pleasure. I love it that Instagram makes it look like I know how to take good photos!

     The same goes for Google+. Facebook Timeline now puts a focus on images (and videos for that matter), and with the changes to the Google+ interface, they are also putting focus on that stuff. That is what Pinterest is… sharing images and videos. Instagram just helps facilitate that to produce better looking images.

    I love Instagram. It is also fun to see what angles I can get on certain photos. I take pictures and I take Instagram pictures. They are rarely the same.

    I’m late to the Instagram game – didn’t want to start another thing – but I do love it!
