An Audio Dock That Joins Macintosh and McIntosh
By ROY FURCHGOTT

The McAire uses Airplay to connect Apple products to a high quality, high cost audio dock.

While Apple, maker of the Macintosh computer, has reveled in bringing us the new, the audio company McIntosh has gloried in electronics that keep to the tried and true. But the two worlds have collided with a McIntosh audio dock called the McAire, which incorporates Apple’s wireless AirPlay system.

AirPlay allows the McAire to connect wirelessly to any Apple product sharing the same Wi-Fi network. Devices can also be connected to the dock by USB cable.

Like most McIntosh equipment, the McAire has considerable heft — 31 pounds of it. That consists of a 25-watt amp, two 4-inch woofers, two 2-Inch midrange speakers and two ¾-inch tweeters.

The unit features the distinctive old-school McIntosh styling, with a black gloss faceplate housing two blue VU meters and showing the brand name in glowing green.

The McAire connects to your Wi-Fi using an i-device for setup. I used an iPhone and it was the simplest AirPlay connection I’ve tried yet.

The sound quality was very good, which can be a bit of a problem: It was good enough that the flaws in the more compressed recordings were easy to hear.

But as McIntosh aficionados are used to hearing, it’s going to cost you. The McAire lists for $3,000.
