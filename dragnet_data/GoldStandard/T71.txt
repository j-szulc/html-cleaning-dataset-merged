The Anti-Torture Memos: Balkinization Posts on Torture, Interrogation, Detention, War Powers, Executive Authority, DOJ and OLC

Marty Lederman

For ease of reference, we've grouped together [and updated] our posts on the complex of issues raised by torture, interrogation, detention, war powers, Executive authority, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Legal Counsel. We've also included a few related op-eds that Jack wrote before this blog began in January 2003. We've posted a link to this compendium on the Balkinization front page, and we update the list as new posts are written. We also have a version arranged by topic, but as of now it's only updated through December 22, 2006.

Thanks ... this is a useful resource that probably would make a good print collection too. But, that is more complicated, and online access is useful on its own.

Off topic, some might be interested in the Dred Scott re-consideration that is available on the C-SPAN website. A portion was aired yesterday, but the website has a lot more material available for those who can download Real Audio etc.
    Joe : 11:58 AM

 

Thank you for providing this wonderful resource. Who needs it in print when it's just a keystroke away? ;)

Seriously though, Balkinization has become my first stop when I try to sort out the developments and impact of the courts' latest decisions. Thank you for providing access to your expertise and scholarship.
    Matthew Frederick : 2:27 PM

 

This is an extremely valuable resource. We readers very much appreciate the work you've done both in making the posts and organizing the collection.

Personally, I think Congress should do it the other way around. The President is free to assert executive privilege and apply to a court for a protective order preventing the testimony of Ms. Taylor. However, in the absence of a protective order, I would hold Ms. Taylor in contempt and lock her in the House jail until she is ready to testify.
