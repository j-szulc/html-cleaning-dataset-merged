good couple of days

Today we launched something huge, important and serious in a responsibly sober way.

Yesterday we launched something cute, frivolous and tiny, in a noisily silly way.

I'm very grateful to have such talented, thoughftul, hardworking groups of people in my life. And such a brilliant balance of important and silly.
