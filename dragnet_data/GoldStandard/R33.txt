Chrono Trigger is now available on Android, making it officially available on everything ever made ever. Okay, that's not true, but Square Enix's classic has already released for DS, Virtual Console, PSN, iOS, and mobile phones. Which means the only current gaming device not to have it yet is Xbox 360 - the key word being yet. Yup, it's just a matter of time...

It'll cost you $9.99 to experience the SNES RPG on Android, the same price as on iOS. The port includes the Dimension Vortex and Lost Sanctum bonus areas from the DS re-release.
