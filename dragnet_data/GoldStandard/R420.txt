KENNEWICK, Wash. - Justin Feser had three goals and an assist, and Marcus Messier and Brian Williams added two goals each as the Tri-City Americans dumped the Vancouver Giants 9-1 in WHL play Sunday.

Tri-City (12-6-2) won its third game in three nights — all at home — to move to the top of the U.S. Division with 26 points.

Vancouver (5-12-0) remains last in the Western Conference with 10 points.

"When you work hard, sooner or later it will go your way," Tri-City coach Jim Hiller said. "We got great contributions all weekend."

The Americans also got goals from Beau McCue and Michal Plutnar.

Tri-City rookie goalie Brenden Fiebelkorn won his first career start, finishing with 14 saves, and stopped a penalty shot by Trevor Cheek at 13:41 of the second period.

The Americans led 2-0 after the first period, then exploded for five goals in the second for a 7-0 lead. Feser competed his fifth career hat trick at 1:54 of the third period, giving Tri-City an 8-0 lead.

Cheek had the Giant’s lone goal at 4:55 of the third. Payton Lee and Tyler Fuhr combined for 29 saves in the loss.
