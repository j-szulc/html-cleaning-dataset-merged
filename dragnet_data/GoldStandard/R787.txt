Food Network Kitchen Debuts in Fort Lauderdale
Monday, November 12, 2012, by Matthew Kang 

Food Network Kitchen opened its first location this past Thursday at Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, a fast-casual traveler's cafe "inspired" by the kitchens and cooking of the network's test kitchens.The fare touts fresh food, local wholesome ingredients, sustainable foods, and artisan baked breads - essentially every relevant food label in the book. Instead of an over-the-top Guy Fieri-like spot, there's whimsical chalkboards and TV monitors showing Anne Burrell doing a pot roast. Early reports show menu items such as fried chicken sandwiches, steel-cut oatmeal, and Cuban breakfast wraps. A second location at Atlanta-Hartfield International Airport is currently in the works, scheduled to open in one year.
