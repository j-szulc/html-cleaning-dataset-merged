Pure Space Shuttle Porn (Without the Cheesy Soundtrack)

Finally. A beautiful video of some amazing airplanes – all shot air-to-air – and mercifully devoid of a cheesy soundtrack or lame commentary. Just a camera, a pair of NASA F-18s, the agency’s 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and the orbiter Endeavor.

It’s been a few weeks since we saw the final flight of Endeavor over California. And if you’re going through withdrawals, the extended video shot from one of the NASA F-18 chase planes based out of the Dryden Flight Research Center is a great way to give your brain a brief respite on a Friday.

After the 747 took off from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave desert, the airplane made a grand tour of California, flying over many prominent landmarks. In the video, the first thing you hear is the measured breathing of the F-18 chase pilot working with the videographer who’s sitting in the back seat and using the jet as a mobile, three-dimensional camera platform. And for true airplane geeks, there’s also plenty of good communication between the carrier aircraft pilots and the various air traffic controllers who helped make the unusual flight possible.

After eventually landing at LAX, the Endeavor made its final journey through the city streets of Los Angeles to the California Science Center, where it will eventually be put on public display.
