My Tastemaker Tag Sale on One King's Lane

Mark your calendars, everyone! My first Tastemaker Tag Sale starts this Monday, May 21st at 11am EST. After years of traveling the country, buying only the most beautiful vintage tabletop, lighting, art and accessories I love the most, I've finally decided to share it—and I mean all of it—with you! That's over 250 dazzling treasures never before seen on Etsy or any trunk show in the past, and all of them are priced to sell! Spring cleaning never looked so chic. That's Monday, May 21st at 11am EST. You don't want to miss it!

Hi Eddie!
I would love to be there, but I can not because I'm studying for a university exam, I would like,but sorry I live in Palm Springs, and I have 18 years and I am under the eyes of my parents.
