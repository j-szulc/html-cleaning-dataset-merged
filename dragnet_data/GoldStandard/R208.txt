Photos: Halloween in Hong Kong looks awesome

Hong Kongers don’t really trick or treat, but they do embrace Halloween for its Americanness and its tradition of dressing up in a costume. The costume parties are big, and the biggest is apparently at that most American of locales: Hong Kong Disneyland. But Halloween is observed throughout the city, often by young people. These photos show a striking cultural convergence between east and west in a city that loves to blur the two.
