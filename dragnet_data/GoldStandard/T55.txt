Not So Much A Pitching Duel; A's Outslug and Outlast Angels, 9-8, For Series Win

So, on paper, it isn't even close. The Angels' offense is better than the A's offense in just about every category, the Angels have four legitimate aces in their starting staff, the Angels were the ones who spent money at the trading deadline to improve, and the Angels hit five homeruns today. It's hard not to imagine the Angels' grand hopes of sweeping the series after Jered Weaver completely dominated the A's on Monday night.

But because 2012 is magical, the A's put on their best "Little Payroll That Could" outfit and stormed back; scoring 10 runs last night and 9 today, while staving off a late Angels' comeback to win the series, and putting another game's worth of padding on second place--and the Wild Card.

Normally, I would point out that the Angels should have thought about upgrading their bullpen at the deadline instead, since it's not possible for even their starting pitching to pitch complete games every night, but I don't feel qualified to speak about their bullpen in light of today's scary save by Ryan Cook, but hell, it was a save! And this is the happy, the-A's-won-2-of-3-from-the-Angels-after-being-practically-no-hit-in-the-first-game thread, so whatever. I'll pretend not to worry that Cook nearly blew another 3-run save. He DID record the third out before the third run scored, so CELEBRATION!

The A's somehow came up with nine runs, helped by homeruns by Kottaras and Carter, and unlike last night, they would need every single run to win today's game. Not even the most die-hard pie fan wanted to see the game go into extra innings this afternoon.

As for Dan Straily, you know how there are some days where your starting pitcher gets really unlucky and gives up a lot of bloop hits and the other team picks him apart and it wasn't really his fault that he gave up those runs?

Today was not one of those days.

Straily nearly recorded as many homeruns given up as he did strikeouts; I'm not sure that's a record we're really shooting for here. When you only throw 90 miles an hour, you probably shouldn't make those pitches as hittable as they were today. Although he did strike out five batters in his 4 and 2/3 innings, I think that excitement was negated by the four homeruns he allowed (Morales x2, Iannetta, and Hunter). The Angels would hit their fifth homerun off Balfour later in the game. If there is a bright side, it's that Straily only walked one batter; most of the homeruns he gave up were solos.

Where does one even start recapping this game? The A's went down early in the top of the second after the first Angels' homerun, but stormed back with a Carter walk and George Kottaras' first A's homerun in the bottom of the inning to take a 2-1 lead. After back to back one-out walks in the same inning (showing off a very un-Greinke-like wildness) to Pennington and Weeks, Cliff Pennington, in his first game back, got himself picked off second base. That. Was. Unacceptable. It's bad enough that he's hitting under .200 and never gets on base, but then gets picked off on one of the few times he does get on base? The bases should have been loaded with one out as Coco also walked, but instead, there were runners at first and second with two outs. Luckily for the A's, they don't just walk; they also sometimes hit! Brandon Moss singled in the A's third run. Reddick would single in the fourth run, and the A's jumped out to a 4-1 lead. Greinke walked 5 batters, and all in the second inning. The A's made him pay with four runs.

Comfortable lead? Not so much.

The Angels' second homerun came leading off the third inning, immediately cutting the lead to 4-2. Trout and Hunter both singled with no one out to scare us, but Straily got Pujols to fly out (Trout advanced to 3rd on the play), and Trumbo flied out to Cespedes, who threatened to throw Trout out at the plate if he tried to score, and Straily would get out of the inning without further damage.

Every inning was a nail-biter, as Straily fought to record outs; a nice scoop by Carter closed the fourth inning without incident, but the wheels--which were wobbling all day--finally came off in the fifth. Torii Hunter homered to bring the Angels within one run, and after a single and a botched pick-off attempt, Straily was left in to pitch to Kendrys Morales, who hit an approximately 900 foot homerun off him earlier. That went about as well as one would imagine; Kendrys had himself a two-homer day and the A's were suddenly down 5-4. Jordan Norberto replaced Straily and manged to stop the bleeding. Pat Neshek, The Awesome One, would replace the apparently injured Norberto in the sixth, keeping the A's just down a run. He would also be awarded the win, because he's awesome.

Cliff Pennington would walk again in the sixth inning as LaTroy Hawkins replaced Greinke, and this time he didn't get picked off; he moved to second on a bunt by Weeks. Coco doubled him in to tie the game at 5, but the A's weren't done. After the rare umpire change (Bill Miller was hit hard, and had trouble remembering the count, and just looked in pain), Reddick walked, putting runners on first and second. Coco and Reddick pulled off the old double steal, and Cespedes drove them in with a single, giving the A's a 7-5 lead.

Still not enough.

Chris Carter mashed a homerun for good measure, setting the A's up with a 9-5 lead going to the seventh. They would still need all of it. Balfour allowed yet another Angels' homerun in the seventh, but got out of it with a three-run lead still intact, and Sean Doolittle allowed two singles and made an error to start the eighth inning, but then clutchly struck out the side.

A's lead 9-6, going to the ninth inning, Ryan Cook comes in--surely this time will be different, right? Single, strikeout, single, groundout, 2 RBI single, stolen base, and then a blessed, blessed ground-out to Cliff Pennington.

It wasn't the prettiest win. Or the most relaxing. But whatever. The A's take 2 out of 3 from the Angels (sending them 7 games behind the Rangers) and fly to Chicago to take on the red-hot White Sox starting Friday night. They better bring the good offense.

I think that seeing the Angels hitting bombs improved our swings

Everyone was looking for a hit, rather than worrying about making an out.

Hit by a ball back up the middle, mid forearm.

He stayed in a bit, but he MIGHT have been injured. Or not. Maybe just precautionary. I hope. Because he’s the best Houdini on the team to come in with runners on and get out of it. him and Blevins…

A few extra stray thoughts...

- We haven’t seen “the real Straily” yet, I’m sure of it. No way does he K 175 even AA/AAA hitters with the slider he showed against TOR or the changeup he showed today. I’ll reserve judgment until I feel we’re seeing his real “good stuff” before deciding how good I think he can (or can’t) be.

- All fastballs by Cook…? Perhaps he was told “just focus on the fastball and locate it” or perhaps they feel teams are sitting on his slider or maybe he had a sucky slider in the pen, I don’t know. Odd, though.

- Awesome AB by Cespedes in the 6th, and I heart Chris Carter. That is all.

- Nice to win on a day where you give up 5 HRs, make 3 errors, and get picked off in a key spot. Hmmm…

To me, he looks terribly overamped, but I didn't really see anything except a long lens of him in AAA for comparison.

He’s working on controlling his breathing, he’s very animated and fidgety on the mound. As a guy who probably expected to be pitching all year in AA, this might not be surprising if he’s got nerves. I felt like after the first bomb, he started nibbling. I doubt that’s his real style, since he had low walk totals in the minors.

Pennington simply left to soon

Greinke lifted his leg…not so sure he didn’t move toward home. I was only 300 feet away…that’s what I saw!

I wonder about Straily’s day/night splits. I think he was over-throwing…not in the first inning (3Ks) but afterwards. Maybe the long 45 minute bottom of the 2nd got to him. I was looking for my car keys…“Gotta be five-thirty or so…!”

Stary though on Cook and his fastballs... and Weeks

Being from the NYC area, I notice these are 2 guys that unfortunately remind me of the NY Mets days with Armando Benitez and Kaz Matsui. Everyone wants to love them, and they constantly make us want to love them with brilliant but brief flashes of talent…. and then their everyday play just makes us bitter towards them. I can remember the media clamoring to trade those 2 while people still thought they had talent, but the Mets held on and got nothing in return. ….. This seems similar to me. Our only positive is that our guys are very young, so maybe the waiting game pans out.

Do we feel

yet, that we wouldn’t be dealing vintage Bret Saberhagen if we moved Straily this offseason for a real infielder who can hit?

I'm not overreacting

In fact I was one of the few to not drool endlessly over an impressive season in the minors. Is he not going to make it? Is he going to be a 5th starter? No, I didn’t say that one way or the other. My whole opinion was this:

I think he’s replaceable and could get us players at positions that we’ve struggled to replace over the last 25 years.

He has written him as as nothing special from the start

I really don’t know why I spend the time replying anymore.

by Copenhagen on Aug 8, 2012 10:36 PM PDT    
He may or may not be anything special. Why is it in any way

unreasonable to think he isn’t special? Who other than the A’s and some A’s fans think he is anything special? Goldstein had him as the 20th best pitching prospect. Sickels says he’s a B+, which is basically consistent with Goldstein’s ranking, and isn’t special.

You say “we don’t know anything yet”. Well we do know something. We know how hard he throws. We know his minor league numbers and scouting reports, to the extent that they’ve been made public.

I understand the sentiment to give him a chance before writing him off, but saying he’s not special isn’t writing him off. Most major leaguers aren’t special, but lots are useful anyway. To me he doesn’t seem as talented as Justin Verlander or Felix Hernandez, and he doesn’t look like a future Cy Young Award winner, but he could still be a useful pitcher.

When fans are talking about trading Straily

after only 2 starts, in which he faced 2 of the hardest hitting teams in all of baseball ,it seams pretty harsh to me. The Rangers are 5th in M.L.B. for team batting average and the Angels are 6th and only the Yankees have more homeruns.
Does Straily appear to have rookie jitters? Yes! However, as good as Gio is, he definitely lost his command against the Yankees and Rangers and that’s with many more starts.

he was “untouchable” before? Has anyone changed their mind?

So you think Hanley's DONE?

It’s fine if you do, I just think he has too much talent and would be productive in Oakland. You think he’s Adam Rosales et al. Fair enough I guess if you reall think that’s HanRam from here on out. I suppose a lot of the A’s data are the Hicks HRs (and he’s currently in the minors).

Speaking for myself, I don't think Hanley's "done" as a hitter

However, I do think the defensive hit at SS offsets a lot of what he adds as a hitter. Basically, he is a much, much better hitter than Pennington, but Pennington is a much, much better defensive SS than Hanley.

In balance, it’s still a net gain to go from Pennington to Hanley, but perhaps not as much as one thinks. Perhaps not enough to take on $38M in payroll and deal a very good prospect. Then add in that Hanley’s hitting has actually been only “ok” for 1.5 years running, and it’s hardly a sure thing that in balance Hanley would even be better at all — though I imagine he still would be.

So

in short, we are SCREWED at SS unless Pennington can hit or Green can field. We have little to no shot of ever finding a FA or tradeable SS without trading Yo knows.

Hecchevaria is up, making Y. Escobar very expendable. I suppose JJ Hardy will be available (wheee).

Trouble is, most of the shortstops out there — at least among the ones anyone might possibly trade — are no better than Pennington. Which is also to say that Pennington isn’t that bad.

Solution: Move Cespedes to SS, OF of Smith/Gomes, Crisp, Reddick, sit back and enjoy WINZ!!!

I think he won't, because Luhnow is under no

pressure to trade him.

tko bira, masturbira -- Croatian proverb quoted by elcroata

by WaddellCanseco on Aug 9, 2012 10:45 AM PDT    
I think he will.

He’s two years away from free agency after this season, so he probably won’t be a part of the next contending Astros team.

As for Luhnow having pressure to trade him, if he gets injured again, his trade value continues to drop. If he comes back and plays well to end the season, the Stros should absolutely trade him during the offseason.

His ability to hit and play SS has never been in question, but his ability to stay healthy (even if some of it is freak injuries), and he hasn’t cast away any of those doubts.

He’ll command a good bit more than what Luhnow gave up to get him because Luhnow is smart, but the Astros gave up very, very little to get him.

Dan Straily is more awesome than you.

by humanoid7 on Aug 9, 2012 10:54 AM PDT    
So he'll cost less than Straily + something good?

Still something good, but less than Straily + something good.

Dan Straily is more awesome than you.

by humanoid7 on Aug 9, 2012 11:00 AM PDT    
I'm still not getting why Luhnow needs

to trade him for that little rather than keep him and hope he stays healthy enough to trade for more than that.

by WaddellCanseco on Aug 9, 2012 11:03 AM PDT    
Because him not staying healthy is a huge risk

if he ends up on the 60 day DL or misses significant time again, his trade value is gone and it ain’t coming back.

And the likelihood of that happening again is higher than the likelihood of him increasing his trade value in spite of service time.

before you have an aneurysm, i think you should hold off until we're in the offseason. our trade chips are worth more in the offseason than at the trade deadlines.

next year, we’ll have a full year of carter and a healthier starting staff and a more mature bullpen.

it’ll be fine. relax.

I thought pretty much anyone who ends up in MLB

played SS in high school. It’s the hardest position, so the school puts the best athlete there. The guy who ends up in MLB is probably the high school’s best athlete, even if he turns into a crappy LF in the bigs.

All we know is he can throw from SS

I would be very interested to see him actually play there for a game. He could be a ton worse than Hanley Ramirez, or he could hold his own. He sure isn’t holding his own in LF (but he is in CF, oddly enough). His bat would play fantastic at SS.

I didn't see you comment yesterday that I remember, but he made one AWEsome play from LF

Came way in on a ball, caught it and fired a strike to home plate that would have had Trout dead in the water, except he wisely retreated. And THAT is why I want him to learn LF. If Coco, or Smith or Gomes is out there, Trout scores for sure, and only Coco would’ve caught the ball.

This is a genuine question

Is Han Ram’s defense THAT bad? I really know nothing about it, other than that on A’s N people act like he is the worst SS to ever start in the position. The idea that Pennington’s great D is comparable to Hanley’s (potential) great O seems kinda absurd to me—but maybe it’s true.

I mean Cespy is a terrible LF right now, but his offensive production makes up for it ten times over. I know SS is a much more challenging and important position than LF, but I gotta believe Haney at his best makes up for it with the bat just like Cespy does.

Yes? No?

It not help me, it help you.

Agreed. People overreacted in both directions now

He isn’t as good as people were making him out to be from his minors figures. And he’s not as bad as people are making him out to be from his MLB starts.

Okay, maybe he’s not ready to take MLB by storm immediately. That doesn’t mean you trade him, you at least have to hold him and try him out at ST next year. Then if you can’t make use of him maybe you trade him.

Woo-hoo

2 outta 3 from a prime wild-card & division rival. Way to right the ship. This is what good teams do. Sometimes you need to win the ugly game.

In other news, Cleveland finally snapped an 11-game losing streak. Had the Twins won, they would have caught up with Cleveland for 4th place in the Central. Talk about a cautionary tale. In the AL, a couple really bad weeks and you go from wild card contender to doormat. Something to ponder.

This could be the 2012 American League

Yankees and Rangers and Angels are really really good talentwise/on paper, but have very obvious holes that can be exploited.

There’s a wide smattering of teams that are very close in talent and results, and they all have their strengths and major holes.

Then, the AL basement (Seattle, Minnesota, KC, maybe Cleveland), aren’t as bad as the AL “basement” as the worst teams in the AL have been in past years. They’d all be near .500 in the NL.

No easy cupcake wins, and no unbeatable teams. Looks like a recipe for no 90+ win teams.

Dan Straily is more awesome than you.

by humanoid7 on Aug 8, 2012 5:43 PM PDT    
I'd say the Rangers are the best out of all. I'd fit the teams into a few loose categories:

The top: Rangers, Yankees
Hopefuls: slegnA, A’s, Orioles, Rays, Tigers, White Sox
Red Sox are in between
Has-beens: Blue Jays, Indians
Basement: Mariners, Royals, Twins

And those can all quickly change other than probably the top two.

60% of the time, it works every time.

by Torrey's Tacos on Aug 8, 2012 5:45 PM PDT

Rangers are finally getting it together (and that’s not a good thing).

Yankees are just crashing down though.

by patrick.mcreary.733 on Aug 8, 2012 5:46 PM PDT    
Plus, if you go to eSPN sports (solely for the following reason)

You can sort the team statistics by Month, pre-or-post ASB, etc. Seattle dug themselves a very very deep hole; they can’t hit homeruns, and yet: Their team stats and W-L record are not looking real basement-like since the ASB. Just as the A’s team stats completely understate what kind of team they are because the whole lineup was hitting at about the Mendoza line in Apr/May. Now that same lineup is actually hitting and scoring better than texas since the ASB.

by justANotherAsFan on Aug 8, 2012 5:51 PM PDT    
was at the game, a couple notes on straily (obvious as they may be)

Hurried himself wayyyy too much. He absolutely should’ve taken a breath or two between pitches. Instead, he would just nod and go into the windup. Even a quick deep breath would’ve helped him.

His fastball still had movement, that was pretty obvious from where I was sitting, but his command was so bad with it today, those homers were no doubters.

Changeup was still the filthy 70 pitch that it’s been hyped to be.

Slider was off and on, when thrown well it was downright nasty

The curveball is what it is, a get-me-over pitch that’s good for a first strike

his mechanics out of the stretch are flawed, there were times that he’d fly open a little early. That made his change up better but didn’t help his fastball or slider whatsoever, which seem to be his pitches of choice out of the stretch.

After giving up the tying run to Crisp with less than two outs and with the go-ahead run on 2B, I see no reason why LaTroy Hawkins (RHP) should have been allowed to face Cespedes after Reddick got on. (Leaving him in to face Reddick was questionable)

After Cespedes got his 2 run single? Inexcusable to leave him in there.

Not when the slegnA have an off day tomorrow, Weaver saved the pen on Monday, and the pen is rested.

For that, thanks Scioscia for gifting the A’s a win. And it gives me appreciation for Melvin’s bullpen usage (for the most part.)

Tip your cap to Bob Melvin

These Athletics are clearly having fun playing as a team and playing way above expectations thanks to their cohesion.That can happen when you have a good leader. A leader who has the players trust, who gives them clear signals (Cook is the closer, ergo he closes), and leads with conviction – that is an incredibly valuable asset. We can all point fingers at his specific decisions, here or there (Bench Cook. Now, Bob.), but who could say that this team isn’t better than it was in the late 00’s because of the change in Bobs?

Really, though, if the players don't execute

then all Melvin’s moxie doesn’t matter. I remember how forlorn he looked in the Seattle dugout, and I used to think “loser!” (or, in the parlance of the internet, “LOOSER!”).

With even part-time Cespedes, and Reddick, compared to last year??

The Athletics have hit twice as many HRs compared to last year. I’d say it’s Curt Young plus HRs. We did have a nine-game losing streaks, and mostly because Melvin insisted on using Fuentes, when everyone on this board said, “NOOOOOOOO!” as well as Cook recently.

I think Straily will be fine

He seemed a little over-amped in this game and threw some mistakes. It happens to young pitchers and I think he’ll find a way to pace himself a little better.

Cook, on the other hand, shows no sign of settling down and turned in another poor performance. He had plenty of rest so there really aren’t any excuses for him. I’d much rather see Balfour closing; he might have an occasional blown save but he won’t self-destruct in a long string of games.

It would be nice to see someone really nail down the #2 spot in the lineup. Too bad Pennington and Weeks have been a bust there.

by coffee roaster on Aug 8, 2012 7:32 PM PDT reply  
Should Melvin send Cook to AAA?

Figueroa is much more stable.
Doolittle has finally gotten control of the fastball.

by patrick.mcreary.733 on Aug 8, 2012 7:34 PM PDT    
Naw, I'd keep him around

But he doesn’t seem to handle the closer pressure well. Let him throw a few 7th innings and see how he does. He has tremendous velocity – his command seems off. He’s too talented to just dump back to AAA.

by coffee roaster on Aug 8, 2012 8:34 PM PDT    
wasn't his conrol always spotty?

by MobiusKlein on Aug 8, 2012 9:01 PM PDT    
Yes it was.

But, he was pretty much unhittable so it didn’t matter. Lately, not so much.

If I had to pick one of our guys to be "closer"

It would probably be Doolittle, just because he combines “hard to hit” with “low BB totals” — plus he has not allowed a HR (they can be quite ungood when given up by closers).

Balfour’s my next choice, though he’s a bit BB prone and HR prone — but he’s very good overall. Cook’s my #3 and like you said is currently a mess anyway.

Mostly, don’t pitch a closer who’s gassed. No need to run Doolittle out there to throw 91MPH or to pitch Cook 3 days in a row. If nothing else, go with the freshest arm and you’re likely to do better than you will with any one of those being “the guy”.

I'd rather see a closer by committee at this point

It hasn’t worked well for other teams but we have a pretty good assortment of relievers. I agree, choose the 9th inning based on the situation at hand, who’s rested, look at the matchups etc. There were a couple of spots where even Blevins would have been perfectly serviceable in the 9th inning in the last couple of weeks. Just jamming Cook in there night after night hasn’t done him any favors.

by coffee roaster on Aug 8, 2012 8:38 PM PDT    
Agreed

The 3rd game vs the Blue Jays could have been won had Blevins came in.

by patrick.mcreary.733 on Aug 8, 2012 8:39 PM PDT    
Agree with committee idea

This is the ideal club for it. You aren’t trying to mix and match a 15 yr vet with a couple of raw guys. Everyone is pulling well together, and I think they’d buy the “committee”.

and I trust Melvin to run this committee quite well.

by sf drift king on Aug 9, 2012 12:22 AM PDT    
He seems like he likes a designated closer and will continue with someone in that role to be determined

Not arguing for one or another, just how Melvin manages. The only thing I can say at this point is It needs to not be Cook.

I didn't say it was your fault. I said I was going to blame you

They’re going for the sweep. Gio Gonzalez is close to getting a full game.

by patrick.mcreary.733 on Aug 8, 2012 7:46 PM PDT reply  
Does is still count as a sweep if it's against the Astros?

I feel like you should put up a +20 run differential or something to officially call it a sweep. Simply winning 3 against Houston is too easy a task.

by Ciderbeck on Aug 8, 2012 9:00 PM PDT    
Take the win. Move on.

A team of rookies, near rookies, castoffs, career end-of-the roaders and one MVP (Cespedes) is in the August hunt for the playoffs. The kids are either going to do it or take their lumps while failing to do it. Either way, the lessons learned will be invaluable. We couldn’t have asked for a better scenario.

Glad you're back! However,

I regret to inform you that the “Carter bomb” and in fact the entire 6th inning was just a side effect of the fabulous drugs you have taken.

In reality, the slgnA won 8-4. So sorry. With that loss, the A’s are now in position to grab the #6 pick in all of baseball, and I guess we should be happy about that. Iwakuma didn’t pitch too badly, though. It’s just that fucking Bobo the clown left him in too long. We do have a guy named Carter, still stashed in AAA. He and that Brandon Moss fellow have really been tearing it up there and we all here on AN would sure like it if Bob (who is both GM AND mgr, after BB’s sudden retirement after the utter failure of the movie ‘Moneyball’) would bring one of them up. Barton conTINues to underwhelm at 1B. Cust looked better, though. It’s great that Penny’s back, with most of the roster hitting below .200… It’s too bad Gio’s sterling effort was wasted.

Just like you. Wasted. Get it?

I just don’t think the ‘window of opportunity’ will EVER come for us. I’m getting that Kansas City kind of feeling.

Please shut up Hawk Harrelson

It would be music to these ears if the A’s can take the series against the Pale Hose. Having to listen to Foghorn Leghorn Harrelson pontificate is nauseating. I live in Chicago and the only time I can catch a full game is when they play them (Have AT&T for cable so no MLB Extra Innings).

The best part is when the White Sox are losing. Gets awfully quiet. You can put it on MUTE YES!

This umpire doesn’t know the game of baseball, and these A’s should not be winning! This umpire has no business and the Oakland A’s should not at all be in this wild card race!”.

Sure, he’s a homer, but he’s an obvious, flamboyant (for lack of a better word) one well beyond the point of pompousness unlike some of the other more homeristic broadcasters out there who veil it.

Kudos to bbg for the recap

Captured all the good features of this game.

I must say, as much as I like taking in a ballgame in person, all those Angel home runs were distinctly negative to my enjoyment. Add in the snail’s pace, and all my enjoyment was truly that we won. I had a great moment with my fellow A’s fan on the Carter HR.

He flat out gets on base. And he hits some impressive home runs. High drives. Long drives. His fielding and glove are better than I heard about, but he’s still had a couple bonehead plays. But I am completely happy with his performance.

by Town Biz on Aug 8, 2012 9:59 PM PDT    
Though it should be noted that today's error was his 5th

He is starting to regress into the fielder he is, which may not be as abysmal as I feared, but is still ungood.

The errors are a concern still, but he's better than I expected defensively.

His errors, or at least today’s and two others, are more of the bonehead, lack-of-attention variety rather than the immobile, bricks-for-hands variety. He’s missed balls thrown right at him, at at least right at his upper shins, yet he’s ranged to his right well on grounders and showed what I believe to be impressive range over his shoulder and into foul territory numerous times.

All in all, he’s still no JT Snow (and thank God) over there, but I’ve been impressed. His variety of errors I think will fade. His range and, yes, athleticism can’t be taught. I see hope of him sticking in his 27-game SSS, but him sticking would go a long, long way.

by RyanFromBonas on Aug 8, 2012 10:24 PM PDT    
Missing balls thrown right at him is a big red flag for me. He seems like a terrible

fielder who makes us pleasantly surprised when he does something good. Ryan Howard and Prince Fielder make good plays occasionally too.

True about throws straight at him.

but he has also fielded a couple of smashes right on the line that neither Howard nor Fielder, nor even Texeira usually get. I don’t know what to make of his fielding, but it’s not as bad as I was imagining overall, and I’ll live with that.

I had high hopes that by next year he'd be a very good player. I knew he was talented

but in my heart I thought he would bat .250 at best and hit maybe 20 HRs. He’s a much more complete player though. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s among the league leaders in infield singles. He just hits the ball hard each time and runs out almost everything. I hope he gets real hot and starts hitting a ton of homers too. He’s had a bit of a power outage lately. Not that I’m complaining about a .310 hitter haha.

by DDroney on Aug 9, 2012 2:10 AM PDT

"On paper"

I’m so tired of people talking about how good some team is “on paper”. What the heck does that even mean?

As far as I can tell, saying a team is good “on paper” means nothing more than that the conventional wisdom thought they would be better, except that the conventional wisdom was wrong because it’s stupid and overrates familiar names and media publicity.

I think a lot of A’s fans buy into the “on paper” myth because we enjoy the whole over-achieving underdog mystique, as if it’s somehow more cool to win games when you’re really an inferior team. But that’s bullshit. We’re not an inferior team at all. The A’s are just as good as the Angels, even a little better, and the results reflect that. If the media coverage prior to the season universally predicted that the Angels would be great and the A’s would be terrible, that doesn’t mean the Angels are better “on paper”; it just means the media coverage was wrong.

That's interesting

I’ve always thought that “on paper” was meant to describe the result if the players of a team were to continue to play to their career norms, or in the case of rookies, go through normal rookie growing pains and not look like Mike Trout or Cespedes. “On paper,” Reddick was supposed to be similar to Sweeney in terms of OPS and fielding. But that paper is changing.

This.

If you compare the Angels career stats to the A’s career stats, the zAngels look like the better team. Of course that’s not the case, but “on paper” the Angels looked like the better team starting the season.

Even if you compare 2012 stats, the Angels look like the better team.

It’s the A’s clutchiness that’s got then 1.5 games ahead of the Angels. And the clutchiest of all A’s has been Coco Crisp, followed by Jordan Norberto, Derek Norris, Yoenis Cespedes and Brandon Hicks. These are the real heroes.

That's exactly what I'm talking about.

Conventional wisdom overrates big names. “The players of a team were to continue to play to their career norms”. But they don’t. This is the same kind of thinking that leads to stupid picks for the All Star games.

You say the paper is changing, but it’s not changing fast enough. It should change with every day’s actual results. The real paper says that the A’s are a game and a half better than the Angels. It also says Josh Reddick is better than Albert Pujols. The judgment attributed to “on paper” is just the judgment that hasn’t caught up to reality yet.

Saying a team is good on paper

Basically means that. When you read it in the newspaper or article or something like that, it’s all exciting. Then, you suddenly realize that the team completely sucks. Anyone remember the infamous “Our Time” from the KC Royals?

Spent so much money pumping into the team, fans, etc only to completely fail.

it's a common thing in all of sports

The on paper is just this – look at the Rangers and Angels lineup, starting rotation, look at their WAR from last year, then look at the A’s from last year, plus all the rookies, etc.

Look if we still had Barton at 1B we would be awful. The good thing about paper is…it’s not set in stone…ugh I feel bad for saying that. Sorry guys.

What I meant by it is that the A's offense completely sucks

If—and Lordy is it a HUGE if—I think we would have the lowest batting average in MLB history. We might anyway, actually; our numbers are pretty much at the bottom of 30 teams. Yet we’re winning.

Line up those numbers “on paper” and you tell me how the A’s beat the Angels. We’re not a better team overall; we’re not as good as the Angels. We beat them in one series, but they have the far superior team. Our bullpen is better, and that’s it. That’s literally the only spot where we have superior players.

by baseballgirl on Aug 9, 2012 9:01 AM PDT    
But I don't think the offense sucks...completely

How long has it been since we’ve had two COF who can hit for power? Think of the dreck we’ve thrown out there in the last five years and look at who we have now. They don’t completely suck.

Since Inge and Carter joined the team, we have two corner infielders who can also hit for power (albeit with Inge, a lower BA). If you were putting a team together on paper, I think you’d be happy with the results on the IF and OF corners. It’s been years since we’ve been able to say that.

Imagine plugging even a slightly above league average at SS and I think this would be a pretty good offensive team on paper. They won’t have sluggers 1-9 but they’d have enough offense to support the pitching, which is all that matters. And the bullpen issue can’t be emphasized enough – LAA is losing a lot of games because of that terrible pen.

by coffee roaster on Aug 9, 2012 9:25 AM PDT    
Fair enough

We DEFINITELY have upgraded the 3-5 spots, but our 7-9 is a BLACK HOLE. Well, that’s not totally fair, Jemile has been better lately. But wow…we have a lot of .200 hitters.

by baseballgirl on Aug 9, 2012 9:39 AM PDT    
Yeah, we do.

But some of our .200 hitters make up for their offensive deficiencies on defense….Pennington, Inge. I can’t say that yet for Weeks, but I also think that Weeks has more offensive potential than those two at some point. I’m not sold on Norris either offensively or defensively but that is what it is.

It’s that awful Sogard/Rosales duo that makes the team look so much worse on paper. They really need to be working the waiver wire this month and find us a better IF backup. Sogard is slightly better on defense but he can’t hit. I hate seeing either of these guys in the lineup because they really drag it down. The lineup can absorb a Pennington but it can’t absorb a Pennington and Sogard because Inge is being given a day off. If we aren’t getting a better shortstop then we’d better improve the backup positions ASAP because these two are just awful

by coffee roaster on Aug 9, 2012 9:55 AM PDT    
It's not a mystery.

The Angels have better hitting overall. We have better pitching overall. Combine the two and we’re roughly equal. The most certainly aren’t a “far superior” team.

I think you (BBG) overrate the Angels starting pitching. Possibly because you’re down there hearing their hype every day. Weaver has been good this year, and Wilson has been OK. That’s pretty much it.

by iglew on Aug 9, 2012 10:09 AM PDT    
I'm not so sure we have better overall pitching

We have a better bullpen, that is for sure. But are Colon, Parker, Strailey, Milone, and Griffin really better than Weaver, Greinke, Wilson and Haren?

Apparently, in that Haren has been mediocre (due to injury it turns out)

and Greinke has been bad (so far). Going forward, i.e., “on paper,” you’d probably take their rotation, but in reality, i.e., actual 2012 performance, ours has actually been better.

The A's score runs

I keep reading things like ‘“our numbers are pretty much at the bottom of 30 teams. Yet we’re winning.” but the numbers take into account the atrocious months of april and may,we weren’t winning back then!

In june they were 9th in the MLB in runs scored , in july they were 14th and so far this month they’re 13th.Those rankings are not great but it’s far from the bottom of 30 teams.

by totoum on Aug 9, 2012 10:24 AM PDT    
Right - basically we know

Donaldson, Hughes, Barton…don’t score runs. But they’re not around. Our 1Bman has an OBP of .400 and an OPS over 1.000. That scores runs!

the question now is whether there's a better way to use the moss roster spot. do we keep moss and his 1B/OF utility and platoon him with Carter (1B/DH) or do we upgrade moss somehow (shane spencer)?

I see Moss not as "great" or "awful" but rather as "streaky"

Long term, the A’s should still, IMO, be in the market for a 1Bman (Carter to DH), but for now the Moss-Carter platoon seems fine to me. If Moss gets hot (and it looks like he might be moving in that direction again), I think he’s capable of another really good stretch. It’s just the extended bad stretches that may not be worth it long-term.

by stm72 on Aug 9, 2012 10:41 AM PDT    
My guess/fear is that he's genuinely "streaky"

but that it’s “2 parts bad to 1 part streak” — that you have to endure a bit too much bad to wait for the next streaky period.

I agree.

I understand “on paper” arguments/discussions in the offseason because that’s all you can really talk about. But 110 games into the season, you really shouldn’t be using “on paper” to back an argument. Otherwise the Phillies would’ve still been favorites in the NL (before their fire sale). What matters is results (with a large enough sample size), and the A’s are one of the best teams in the AL.

I’d say a waiver deal is looking less likely. maybe pennington gets on a hot streak, provides steady defense. with rosales, sogard mixed in. 4 SS’s used this yr, just like first base.

so, with the above discussions about "on-paper," etc. our schedule is

about to get as easy as it gets in the American League, after the CWS series. We need to clean up on this part of the schedule heading into September, where we play all of the AL WEST as well as Det and NYY.

1st, our next Five:
Fri, Aug 10: A’s @ White Sox; McCarthy (6-3) v. Floyd (8-9)
Sat, Aug 11: A’s @ White Sox: Milone (9-9) v. Liriano (3-10)
Sun, Aug 12: A’s @White Sox: Parker (7-6) v. Sale (13-3)
Tue, Aug 14: A’s @ Kansas City: Colon (9-8) v. Guthrie (4-12)
Wed, Aug 15: A’s @ Kansas City Straily (0-0) v. Smith (2-4)

Then:
From Thursday, August 16th to Thursday, August 30th:
1 vs KC, 7 vs. Cleveland, 3 vs. Minnesota, 3 vs. Tampa Bay

Let’s say we lose the series to the Chicago White Sox, 1-2…..We then need to win each of the following series, in my opinion, to stay afloat before the stretch run. If we can take 2 of 3 versus Kansas City, 2 of 3 from Minnesota, 2 of 3 from Tampa Bay and 5 of 7 against Cleveland, that’s an 11-5 stretch, which would be great.

Good news is that KC and Cleveland can’t pitch, and as we did in the Angels series, we can feast on bad pitching. Our rotation and pen is strong enough to keep these teams down.
