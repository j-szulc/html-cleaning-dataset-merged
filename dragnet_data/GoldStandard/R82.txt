Glacier

People ask us every day what our favorite place we've visited is.  Each of us says something different-  and this year my favorite place has been the Canadian Rockies, closely followed by Glacier National Park. These places are just stunning- they have a strong effect on me, and I think the rest of my family too.
For example, when I go to Glacier I feel like I never want to leave. I feel like I need to hike every trail, eat only natural things, never brush my hair, just be a hippie. I love the sense of wide-open-world we find there, the friendly, helpful people, the clean air, the insane beauty. 
While we were in Glacier this year we met up with Angie Monson and her family, and camped for a few days, and did a photo/video shoot, hippie style.
Check out the video and photos below- and tell us where your favorite place in the world is!
