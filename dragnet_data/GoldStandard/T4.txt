Kelly Ripa Botox Confession	

The adorable Live! host readily and proudly admitted in a recent interview she uses Botox as much as possible– Get the details here!

Kelly Ripa, 41, could pass for a woman in her early 30s and while she naturally has a young face, she willingly admitted to In Touch she goes for Botox injections to maintain that baby-faced glow!

Kelly told the magazine: ‘I work out every day. I don’t overeat. I try to drink water, but I prefer wine, and when all else fails, I get Botox injected right here, right into my forehead as much as possible!’ She also says, her kids are the ones who tell her when she needs a tune up: ‘It’s when my kids start asking me if I’m mad at them, and I say, “Why do you think I’m mad at you?” They say it’s because I’m frowning. I go, “Oh no! I am? I’ll be right back!”‘

Kelly’s doctor of choice: the famed Dr. Fredric Brandt. In fact Kelly is such a big fan, she refers to him as her “real husband.”  Dr. Brandt’s main goal is to ‘keep Kelly looking like Kelly’.
