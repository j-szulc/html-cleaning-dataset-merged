Kool A.D. – “Manny Pacquiao” Video

Earlier this year, Das Racist rapper Kool A.D. released his Bay-centric 51 mixtape. And now the spare and laconic “Manny Pacquiao,” one of the standout tracks from the tape, has a video in which Kool A.D. hangs out on a farm with an assault rifle, a crossbow, some dancing girls, a pizza, some goats, and Lakutis in an American Gothic costume. Everyone involved clearly had some fun making this one. Watch it below.
