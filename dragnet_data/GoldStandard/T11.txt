Having seen Dishonored at QuakeCon, I got to experience the many ways the game can be played. But Bethesda's new Creative Kills video shows off plenty more ways to eliminate enemies than I thought of, many as amusing as they are deadly.

Chain a few powers together and you can get your deadly swarm of rats to blow up enemies, possess enemies and move them in front of their own gunshots, or get the enemy technology to work in your favor. You'll be bale to choose your own way to kill on October 9.
