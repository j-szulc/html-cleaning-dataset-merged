Poltrona with Acoustics \ Studio KMJ
Jimmy M. | November 6, 2012 

Studio KMJ designed Poltrona with Acoustics. Whether you are listening to music or reading a book the “Rosa” poltrona keeps one shielded with its acoustic absorbing foam and fabric.

The shape of the ROSA chair is inspired by the rose in a particular position. This natural position is clearly seen by roses or sunflowers that direct their head to the sun for their photosynthesis cycle. The strips represent the layers of the rose and contribute to the curves of the volume. The shape acts like a sound and visual protection which is fitted with sound absorbing foam. The Poltrona also turns in a 360° radius.
