Rocky's Autos in Denver is NOT a good place

On June 9 2012, we drive the hour and 15 minutes to Rocky's Autos. We thought we were going to find a decent dependable car with better gas mileage than what we're used to.

Basically, the long and short of it is ... problems!!! Because Rocky's isn't cooperating, I'm filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau today.

My complaint gist:
We needed a dependable car because we have an autistic child who has epilepsy. We need a dependable car to drive to and from the hospital, and with better gas mileage than our other cars.
Before we got the car home, the check engine light went on, and started running rough. We took it to a trusted mechanic who said it needed quite a lot of work. Hubby contacted Mike at Rocky's and was told to bring the car in. The mechanic supposedly replaced the mass oxygen sensor which would fix at least a major part of the check engine light coming on. He didn’t replace the intake manifold seal as he didn’t see any leaks. The engine light came back on the next day and within a few days, the air suspension light came on and stayed on. It is currently at our mechanics where we're spending about $1100 to get the manifold replaced and the entire check engine light issue resolved. That's just THAT issue because there are other not-as-pressing repairs we'll need to make.
 
We realize it was an "as-is" deal. However, if we had known we would have needed to spend close to $3,000 for repairs on our $5,000 car, we would have just fixed our old ones.

I had to drive this car to the children's hospital last week, about an hour drive. The check engine light was almost the entire time. It did not make me feel safe.

Settlement Requested:
We'd like some repairs made to the car OR pay the mechanics bill for the check engine light repairs being done today.




We'll see.  Chances are nothing will be done.
