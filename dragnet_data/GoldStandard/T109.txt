We got some hands on time with the newly launched Asha 305 and Asha 311 today and got around to taking some photos. Here we have the lower end of the two, the Asha 305.

With a 3″ 240×400 resolution screen, the 305 provides a pretty decent experience. The resistive touchscreen takes a bit of getting used to and it makes sense stepping up to the 311 even if just for the much better capacitive screen.

The build is solid and high quality plastics are used all around. The phone itself is a fingerprint magnet due to the glossy nature of the exterior. The call and end buttons are placed on a single piece of plastic at the bottom.

The Nokia logo is emblazoned at the top above the screen. The earpiece is also located here, the phone doesn’t have any ambient light sensors.

The left side of the phone houses the dual SIM card slots. The phone is of the dual-standby nature and allows users to access two SIM cards simultaneously.

The back of the phone has a matte finish material with a large speaker grille in the lower half of the phone.  The back cover slides off to reveal the battery compartment.

The Asha 305 has a 2MP fixed focus camera around at the back of the phone. The lack of an LED flash is a disappointment as it could also serve as a torch in case of an emergency.

The top of the phone houses a micro USB slot, 3.5mm audio jack and the requisite charger port. The Asha 305 is a very nice entry in the lower end segment of phones and performs quite well. The resistive touchscreen and the lack of an LED flash might be an issue for some though. We’ll have a lot more on the phone in our full review shortly.
