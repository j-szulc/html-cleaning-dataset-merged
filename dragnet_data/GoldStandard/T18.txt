Honey Boo Boo Says She Hates Justin Bieber

Alana Thompson or as we know her Honey Boo Boo is one of the breakout stars of the ‘Toddlers and Tiaras’ reality show and now she’s got her own show, the Honey Boo Boo Show.  The child has  more one-liners than our grandma at Christmas. She might only be 6 years old but Alanna’s not holding back when it comes to making her feelings known. And Justin Bieber was one of the first person who she decided to give her opinion on.

“You like Justin Bieber?” asked her mum, June, in an interview with Access Hollywood. “No, I hate him!” came the very determined reply.   But wait a second!  It seems Honey Boo Boo was confused adn she did say she was a fan of ‘Justin Beaver.’ LOL!

Whether or not this is someone else or whether she was getting confused over his actual name, we are not entirely sure. What was clear though is that the precocious young girl is definitely a fan of Taylor Swift and Nickelodeon’s iCarly.

In other news, Honey Boo Boo is scaring babies at a Chuck E. Cheeses near you!
