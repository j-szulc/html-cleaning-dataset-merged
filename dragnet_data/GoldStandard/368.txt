Apple's alleged iPad Mini could see the light of day before the end of September, says KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

In a report released yesterday and covered by MacRumors, Kuo said he expects the new iPhone to debut in September, possibly near the start of the month. The iPad Mini will then follow closely as a second act.

Assuming an iPad Mini does pop up in September, the analyst is anticpating heavy demand. He's already projecting unit sales of 1.8 million just for the few short weeks marking the end of the calendar third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, the new iPad could grab sales as high as 13 million, surpassing those of its bigger brother.

Kuo is also eyeing changes to the 9.7-inch iPad, namely some internal modifications to resolve thermal issues and to cut costs. Those changes are expected in the third quarter but won't be noticed by consumers.

With a new iPhone and possible iPad Mini on the way, the analyst is predicting a blockbuster fourth-quarter for Apple. For the final quarter of the year, Kuo is looking for iPhone sales to surpass 55 million and total iPad sales to reach almost 34 million.

Apple reports its June quarter results later today, which CNET will cover live.
