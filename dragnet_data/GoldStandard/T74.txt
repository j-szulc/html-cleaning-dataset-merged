Here’s one of the most encouraging developments within the GOP: Young Republicans who either don’t share their parents’ views on same-sex marriage and abortion rights or believe that the party should downplay those topics in favor of the economy.

The New York Times reported on younger Republicans in this piece, in which several College Republicans said they actually favor same-sex marriage or believe the issue is too personal for the party to get into.

This report tracks data about younger evangelicals, too. They don’t always share their parents’ views or fervor on big cultural issues.

Naturally, this story resonated with me because I share the views of these younger Republicans. I’m more liberal on social issues, but think the party should really focus its message on growing the economy. President Obama’s very vulnerable there and the GOP has a good growth message to sell.

It may take a long while before younger Republicans gain equal footing with the party’s cultural warriors. But hope’s on the way.
