The Houston Astros have acquired infielder Tyler Greene from the St. Louis Cardinals for cash considerations or a player to be named later, reports Zachary Levine of the Houston Chronicle:

Levine adds that the Astros have designated utility player Brian Bixler for assignment to make room on their roster for Greene.

Greene was selected by the Cardinals in the first round, thirtieth overall, of the 2005 MLB Draft. Over 179 at-bats for St. Louis this season, he’s hit .218/.272/.358 with nine doubles, two triples, four home runs and nine stolen bases in eleven attempts. The 28-year-old owns a line of .218/.295/.329 over his four-year major league career.

Greene has manned every position but catcher and pitcher for the Cardinals over his four seasons, making a majority of his appearances at second base and shortstop.
