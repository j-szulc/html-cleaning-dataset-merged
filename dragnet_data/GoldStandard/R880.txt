A visionary in the true meaning of the word…

Posted Friday #144 of the Startup Success Podcast - which was show #28 from June, 2009.

It’s an interview Pat and I did with Sramana Mitra, one of the most successful and sought-after funded startup consultants out there.

Sramana’s consults, books and online roundtables would make her a “person of interest” to startup founders. But it’s here One Million by One Million program and vision that set her apart:

    One Million by One Million is a global initiative that aims to nurture a million entrepreneurs to reach a million dollars each in annual revenue and beyond by 2020, thereby creating a trillion dollars in global GDP and ten million jobs.

That’s a Big Goal – no messing around.

Give it a listen – what do you think?
