PP/VE and vSphere 5.1 fixes out.

For those who follow in RSS feeds – FYI, the vSphere 5.1 + PP/VE patch is out – and the blog post is updated with the fix details here.

AFAIK – I’m not aware of outstanding “major” blocks to upgrade for EMC customers (we strive to have everything line up with VMware launches, including baking in platform support for new features in advance – you wouldn’t believe the amount of work that goes into that).   There are a few pieces to pull over the line (new VSI plugin for the web client as an example) – but they are non-critical.

The Recoverpoint SRA's are holding us back. When can we expect the SRA's to be certified for SRM 5.1?

EMC's Recoverpoint support for SRM 5.1 is still a roadblock for us. Any idea when the SRA's for Recoverpoint will be updated and/or certified for SRM 5.1?
