More people are interested in the Kindle Fire HD, which starts at $199. But for those who don't want to spend that much, Amazon is running a lightning deal on the entry-level Kindle Fire (8GB), which was updated a couple months ago with a faster processor.

You can pick up the "new" Kindle Fire for $129 or $30 off its list price. That's a pretty nice deal, though I'd personally opt for the Fire HD.

This one will sell out fast but I suspect Amazon will continue to offer spot deals like this throughout the holiday season.
