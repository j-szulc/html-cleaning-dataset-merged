A Lighter Creamy Cole Slaw
Cole slaw tends to fall into one of two camps - vinegar and oil, or dripping in mayonnaise.

I like mayonnaise-based cole slaws, but sometimes it's just too much, particularly if the slaw's friends - potato salad and macaroni salad - are also invited.

This one is much lighter, relying on yogurt for much of the creaminess.

It's also very monochromatic. And sometimes that's just what you need. I mean, there's nothing wrong with shaved bits of carrots or bell pepper in a slaw, but sometimes you want something more ... refined.

After all, a  plate of freshly sliced tomatoes doesn't need a sprinkle of parsley, and a perfect loaf of bread doesn't need a garnish. Right?

When it comes down to it, this slaw is going to be served next to something else. And that something else is unlikely to be pale green. So it's fine if the slaw is monochrome.

The flavor, though, is anything but bland.

Cole Slaw

1/2 head cabbage
1/2 onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1/4 cup Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon horseradish

Shred or chop the cabbage as you like. I usually do a not-too-fine shred, but I know some people prefer the chopped version. Place it in a large bowl. Cut the onion in thirds, then slice thinly and add it to the bowl.

Add the salt and lemon juice to the cabbage mixture. Toss to combine and set aside for 20-30 minutes.

If there's liquid in the bottom of the bowl drain it. Add the pepper, mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, and horseradish. Stir to combine. If the slaw seems a little under-sauced, add more yogurt. Taste for seasoning and add more salt, if desired.

Serve immediately or refrigerate until needed.
