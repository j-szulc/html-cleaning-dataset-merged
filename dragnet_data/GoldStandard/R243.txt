Hot Trailer: Channing Tatum And Rooney Mara Get In On In ‘Side Effects’

“Damn boo, u fart?”

In case you don’t have a giant chart on your wall that tracks the success of Channing Tatum films like I do, our favorite rec center savior had three films that topped the $100 million mark. Those films – The Vow, 21 Jump Street and Magic Mike – allowed C-Tates to show off his chops as a romantic lead, comedian and big ol’ dong shaker, respectively, and even with a shortened role in next year’s GI Joe: Retaliation, he’ll still be able to spray paint “Blockbuster Action Star” on his backwards acid-washed overalls as well.

Now, it seems that the hardest workin’, twerkin’, lay it down, flip it and reversin’ it baller/playboy/actor/producer/baller in $how BizzzNa$t33 is adding suspenseful thriller to his Linked In profile with the new film Side Effects, co-starring Rooney Mara and Jude Law. Tatum plays Mara’s papi, and someone gets killed. That’s pretty much all I took away from the new trailer, but you can take a look for yourself.

It has been a while since I’ve chatted with my boy C-Tates, but I reached out to him about this new role and genre, and he was more than happy to serve me the 4-1-1, yo.

    Yo girl, checks it… so like, u B a murderer? Cuz yo pants is on fire. YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH BOYYYYYYYYYYYY, C-TATES IN DA MUTHA F*CKIN HEEZIZZOUSE!!!!! Yo, so like me n Da Girl Wif Da Dragon Tat2 be all like bump n grind, right? But yo, dat boo B crazy, 4 realz.

I don’t think it’s at all hyperbole to say that I live for Burnsy’s C-Tate’s posts.

“in some instances, death may occur”

Oh…you mean like Soderberg’s career after 2005? Too soon?
