Instagramming Iceland

Wednesday was the New York launch event for the Traveler’s Handbook series and my Food Traveler’s Handbook. (The prior link is to the Amazon paperback version – at present, the book is not yet available in digital format. As soon as both formats are available, I’ll be posting the relevant “where to buy” for all media.) It was a wonderful evening, with people attending from different stages of my life – classmates from law school, friends from New York, travel writers I met after I quit my job and readers I had the pleasure to shake hands with for the first time. I’m still smiling.

I’m also still in the process of going through photos from Iceland and Portugal and Spain, and clawing my way back from the jetlag that won’t seem to dissipate. In the interests of keeping a theme – my Instagramming Portugal post was great fun – I’m sharing a few from Iceland here, with more to come in the days that follow.

Iceland was magical.

With only a few days in the country, I was limited in time but what I did see completely bowled me over. Autumn turned the landscape into a carpet of ochres and reds and patches of mossy green; the weather was so unpredictable that I kept having to remind myself I was in the same country from one minute to the next. Driving the Golden Circle (to Gullfoss, Thingvellir and Geysir) in a day brought some unexpected weather karma too – buckets of sideways sleet and rain would accompany the drive from one place to another, with the sun bursting through the moment the car stopped and it was time to get out.

The long weekend was a perfect marriage of otherworldly scenery and good vodka; days were spent in the car outside Reykjavik or roaming the capital’s streets and nights out bar-hopping with the locals, who know how to party. I’ll be posting on where to find cheap food in town as it’s quite an expensive city, but for now I will leave you with some of the photos from my trip.

Vanilla Skyr: breakfast of champions.

Reyka Vodka in Iceland: dinner of champions. (Not a wise move.)

And, the goodbye from Icelandair….

    Ohhhh, Iceland is gorgeous. I went in the depths of winter, so didn’t get to see as much as I wanted, but I’d go back in a heartbeat. Plus, in winter Gullfoss is almost entirely frozen and it’s spectacular.

    And the meal I had at the Fishmarket is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten – so glad you got to eat there!

    Is it as expensive as everyone says?

        Certain things are quite expensive – you can find cheaper food but a ‘cheap’ bowl of soup was approx. 9-10$, whereas you can find much more reasonable options in a city like NY or Madrid. The more expensive restaurants will run you a similar cost to New York’s mid-to-high range places. The groceries have some products that are quite cheap – Skyr, some local cheeses, etc. but imported fruit and vegetables are priced high. Housing was generally reasonable (also, about NYC prices) but for people coming from Asia it’ll be a lot of sticker shock. The gas prices very high, though renting a car was also not too expensive. It definitely adds up!

    Are those actual Icelandic words or did a cat just run across your keyboard?

    I loved the wide open spaces in Iceland. They were just begging to be photographed.

    These are beautiful shots, Jodi. I’m glad you enjoyed your trip.

    Beautiful photos of Iceland – such a diverse landscape! Also love the quirkiness you’ve captured in the small details of Iceland – on labels, signs and reflections :-)
