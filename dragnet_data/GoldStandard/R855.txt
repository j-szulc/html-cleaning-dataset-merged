Samsung to mass produce Full HD Super AMOLED HD displays in 2013

Samsung is said to begin mass production of 1080p Super AMOLED HD displays some time in 2013, although there has been no exact date set just yet. I guess this can only mean one thing – you know that smartphones of the future will have ever increasing resolution counts, and Apple’s advantage of having a Retina Display on their iPhone will be chipped away as ordinary. Heck, the upcoming Verizon Droid DNA and the HTC J Butterfly in Japan already have Full HD panels with a higher pixel density compared to the iPhone, but those rely on LCD technology instead of AMOLED.

Samsung’s attempt with AMOLED technology being pushed to Full HD territory will also bring along with it advantages such as a broader color gamut, deep black tones, and shorter response time. It remains to be seen whether the mass manufacturing process will be able to experience the kind of yield levels that are sufficient enough to make them worth Samsung’s while. We do keep our fingers crossed that Samsung will be successful with their attempt, as a screen like that on the next version of the Galaxy S series smartphone would certainly be jaw dropping, to say the least.
