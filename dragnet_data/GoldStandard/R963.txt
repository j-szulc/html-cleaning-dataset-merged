Live event with high-profile photographer: Oct 30!
By Haje Jan Kamps

To celebrate celebrate the launch of Michael Freeman’s latest book, his publisher Ilex are hosting a special live event at 6.00pm Britsh time (use this handy converter to find out what time it will be for you) on the 30th October. Remember to add it to your calendar!

Freeman will give a talk explaining the book’s concept and share a few stories about his years as a professional assignment photographer, and then you'll be  to join in the discussion via twitter and a live discussion board, for an interactive masterclass -- completely for free!

I'll be there for sure - what about you?

About Freeman's The Photographer's Story

Tapping into his decades of experience shooting for such publications as Smithsonian, GEO, and Condé Nast Traveller (among many others), Michael Freeman studies the photo-essay phenomenon that took the world by storm and gave storytellers a completely new set of tools to construct their narratives.

Having established how rhythm, pacing, and careful organisation build tension and cultivate interest, Freeman goes on to explain what this means for presenting your own photos, particularly in the new digital formats of online galleries, slideshows, and tablets.
