Aug 09 1:44p by Andy Hutchins

Tiger Woods, noted for his enthusiasm for the sport of golf, took a while to get going at the 2012 PGA Championship in his first round on Thursday. But when he did, Woods put himself in the middle of a pack of golfers not far off the lead.

Woods shot a 3-under 69 at the Kiawah Island Ocean Course, good for a tie for ninth after his first round. He's a fair bit off the pace being set by Joost Luiten, but that's because it's a record-setting pace: Luiten is at 8-under through 14 holes.

Woods began his day on the 10th tee, and had three birdies and two bogeys in his first nine holes. But the third birdie came on the 18th hole, and Woods followed it with two straight birdies on the first and second holes, getting him to 3-under. He added both another birdie and another bogey before his round was done.

Woods' playing partners, Keegan Bradley and Martin Kaymer, had slightly more exciting days: Bradley, the 2011 PGA champion, shot a 4-under 68, while Kaymer, the 2010 PGA champion, misfired for a 7-over 79.
