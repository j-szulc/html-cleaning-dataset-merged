Archives Photos of the Day: Lions Gate Bridge Construction

It was on this day, November 12, 1938, that the Lions Gate Bridge opened to traffic — with little fanfare. It wasn’t until May 26, 1939 that the bridge was officially opened by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. 

In honor of the day the vehicles first took the drive across the iconic span, Lions Gate Bridge Construction is today’s photo feature:

Nice post Rebecca! Love seeing things being built, especially something like the bridge. Wonder what it would be like today if we didn’t have that particular bridge! lol

You do know of course that the bridge was built by the Guinness family just after they had bought the Marine Building.
The bridge was built to allow easy access to the ‘British Properties’ of which they owned a major portion.
And as part of refurbishing the bridge, the Guinness companies strung the decorative lights on the bridge in time for Expo 86.

My great grandfather helped build that bridge.
