RIM Rolls Out Interactive BlackBerry 7 Promo Videos For Feature Phone Users

by the BerryReview Team on October 29th, 2012

It is nice to see that RIM is still promoting their BlackBerry 7 line with a heavy focus of converting feature phone users. James @CrackBerry noticed a new sort of “Choose your own adventure” style YouTube promotion video series for BlackBerry 7. It is actually really cool and interactive where you click on different parts of the video to continue the story as a BlackBerry Curve user or a feature phone user. The results are pretty obvious but funny. I hope they do something like this for BlackBerry 10.

Let us know what you think!
