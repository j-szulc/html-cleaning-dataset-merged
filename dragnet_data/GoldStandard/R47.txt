Nikon D5200 DSLR camera to be announced next

DX is next: the fifth DSLR camera I promised you for 2012 will be the Nikon D5200 that will replace the D5100 in the next few weeks. At  that point I am not sure if there will be any other products announced together with the D5200 - maybe the Nikon WR-T10 wireless remote controller?

The new Nikon D5200 will have slightly different specs than the D3200:

    It will use the same 24MP DX-format CMOS sensor
    EXPEED 3 processor (same as in the D3200)
    ISO range: 100-6,400 (expandable up to 25,600, D3200 could go only up to 12,800)
    2,016 pixel RGB metering sensor (same as the D600, the D3200 had a 420 pixel RGB sensor)
    Continuous shooting speed: 5fps (the D3200 could do only 4 fps)
    Vari-angle LCD screen (3", 921k dots)

    DX and pro is a contradiction in terms now we have cams with DX pixel density of the D800. Theres no point other than cheapness. And pro bodies are not cheap!

        Pixel density isn’t everything. D800 is too slow for fast action. D300s is great for that. If D800 could do 8fps in DX mode then you might have a point. But it doesn’t

                That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. Nikon created a market niche for a sub-$2,000 high-FPS pro body. They can reasonably be expected to provide an update for those users. The D4 is not an option for many.

                then give me the money, so i can buy it. perhaps if you thought a little (which btw is not hard, nor it causes terrible headaches), you would come to a conclusion, that not everybody can afford a d4. and yes, i do need 8 fps, even more.

        We had higher pixel density than D800 in a DX camera (D7000) 1.5 years *before* the D800 was even introduced. If Nikon decides to produce an FX camera with the same pixel density of its latest DX camera (D3200), we’d have a 58MP monster on our hands.

        But again pixel density isn’t everything. And pro digital gear used to be DX long before it became FX. But yeah… whatever you say bucko.

            Another way of stating my point: There is *no* FX offering today that has anything even close to the pixel density of the lowly D3200.

            Thom’s latest essay is worth reading, but IMO the main reason for the D5200 now is that the holiday season is coming and the D5100 is a consumer camera they hope to promote at that time. (the Christmas season is the prime shopping season in the US and Europe. And, from my limited experience, it’s an even bigger shopping season in urban Japan….)

            D7100 and D400 buyers are nowhere near as season sensitive, so they can wait until the New Year (in the marketer’s view)

                I think he was saying that there are cameras marketed towards the amateur market, but if a professional cannot make great pictures on an amateur camera, then they are still an amateur.

                I agree, I’ve seen plenty of people paid to take pictures (“professionals”) that get nothing more than amateur results.

                Saying nothing more can be done to improve the D300s other than put an FX sensor in it is like saying nothing more can be done to improve the D4 except put a medium format sensor in it.

            I like how everyone throws around the word “professional” like it means “great”. There are great photographers, and there are horrible photographers. There are professional photographers and amateur photographers. There is no correlation between the two sets. I can show you amateurs who are better than any professional and professionals who are worse than almost any amateur.

    Posted October 29, 2012 at 10:36 am  

    Actually, its logical. Its not about how old the models are.
    The consumer models is where they have the largest sales volume, and to get these buyers off buying the latest Canon or others brand latest model they will need to have new models at all times. Potensial customers here will buy the latest product just because it is the latest, and of course then it should be better than the previous – because the sales guy is telling them so…

One POS camera after the other… I would love to upgrade my D300, but the the D600 is too small and lacks the dedicated AF button and the D800 is very expensive and too slow (only 4fps). And the D7000 cannont really be considered an upgrade from the D300. We’ll see, what the 7d-2 brings…

(Side note: how dare it was from Sony to introduce new NEX5 and NEX6 models with similar MP count and better high ISO!?! Seems that in this crazy times, only few are brave enough to swim against the tide!)

What to upgrade to?
Posted October 29, 2012 at 9:54 am  

Those specs don’t seem to leave much room for both a D300s and D7000 upgrade. Does admin know what the likely time frame for those updates – or the combined update – are/is?

Plug
Posted October 29, 2012 at 9:54 am  

The lower the model in the range the more frequent the update. I see absolutely no bearing on the arguments for and against a D300s replacement in this news. For those who hope, vehemently from comments, that this D300s replacement does not take place: why? If you don’t want it you will not buy it so why be so vindictive towards those who would like to see it? It would not divert resources within Nikon for the products you want, indeed profits and R&D would benefit all users in the long run. All the anti CX stuff on these pages: if you don’t want to buy in then don’t buy in, but be gracious and accept that some of the new technology going on there will definitely enhance the tech higher up, to the benefit of all of us.

Let’s hope the D7000 replacement does not share this sensor and something more similar to a DX-size D600 sensor!!!!

DxOMark D3200: 24.1 bits – 13.2 Evs – 1131 ISO
DxOMark D7000: 23.5 bits – 13.9 Evs – 1167 ISO
DxOMark D600: 25.1 bits – 14.2 Evs – 2980 ISO

I want to see a D7100/D8000 with a sensor score of 25 bits, 14 Evs and 1500 ISO.

If you need 8 f.p.s to be able to take action pictures, then you need to go back to photography school.

30 years ago, 3 f.p.s was for the top speed for SLR cameras, and good photographers had no problems taking sport/action pictures

Pretty lame update. At least the D5100 had a significantly better sensor than the D3100 (I owned both). All you get with the D5200 over the D3200 is an ISO option to go from super noisy to unusable, 1 more fps (which doesn’t matter as the AF on these entry-level cameras are terrible for action), and a swivel screen. Nikon should just can the D5XXX line and update the D7000.

I guess we don’t know everything about this camera yet, but based on this information they’re not doing too much to match Canon’s T4i specs.

I have a D5100 and would much rather have 11 cross-type sensors and flash commander (that Canon has on their T4i) than a few extra megapixels.

Also hope to see U1 & U2 modes and the improved auto-ISO settings from the D4/D800/D600 line, but probably we won’t see that on anything lower than the D7000 replacement.

What some of you are forgetting is that Christmas is coming up. Nikon wants to cash in and the best way to do that is with the lower end cameras that are less expensive. You know the ones most people can actually afford to buy someone for Christmas.

I bet the D400/D7100 will come next summer. Nikon is not going to abandon the $1200-$1500 price point. Though I think we will see a camera that is a mix between a D7100 and a D300s, not a direct replacement for either.

Mark
Posted October 29, 2012 at 11:09 am  

Well. If the D5100 has the D7k sensor, and will be replaced before the D7k, it looks to me that there will be no true D7100. It may be called a D7100, but will truly be a D400. Once the D5200 is released, I say Nikon will release a D7100/D400 (specs of D400) with a new sensor. From then on, the D400-line sensor will again be put in the D5xxx line of cameras. Let’s hope.

As for the D5200 proposed specs, it looks like a complete waste to me thus far. But, that also makes me think there’s something stuffed up their sleeve here..
