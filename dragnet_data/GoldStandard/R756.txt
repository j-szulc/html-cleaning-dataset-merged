A difficult WOD on a day that is difficult for many. In my books this is very fitting. R.I.P. Lieutenant and thank you for your service.

Hero WOD yes, smart WOD no. For most if not 95% of avid Cross fitters this might be too much. Kudos to those that can finish and/or choose to attempt.

Anything for this hero. Come on people think of the reason why you are doing it, for a man who gave his all for us. If you cant suck it up for 10 miles then you are weak and feable minded. And dont forget why you have a 3 day weekend. It's Veterans day.
Comment #11 - Posted by: Brian at November 10, 2012 6:24 PM

How many meters is 10 miles exacly?
I'm a fellaw from Norway and I think Ive misunderstood the units completely...
Comment #12 - Posted by: a.vika at November 10, 2012 6:36 PM

Hero WODs go far beyond any typical workout. Its a time to honor those that have given the ultimate sacrifice. Today we did "Coe" at our box - CrossFit Posted. It wasn't easy, but they're not intended to be.

RIP Clovis. Thank you.
Comment #13 - Posted by: Matt Krupinski at November 10, 2012 6:39 PM

a.vika - 10 miles is roughly 16,000 meters.
Comment #14 - Posted by: Scott at November 10, 2012 6:52 PM

10 miles is 16000 meters or 16 kilometers.

Awesome. Love crossfit always taking you past your percieved limits. Running is my weakness and does anyone like burpees. This will literally take me almost two hours. I ship out for basic in February so I guess I better get used to running. Thank you Clovis and I will be thinking of your sacrifice during the 10 miles and 150 burpees.
Comment #18 - Posted by: Hollyhog at November 10, 2012 7:32 PM

For those of you who won't do it because it is TOO HARD! This MAN died TWO (2) days prior to leaving Afghanistan after his tour was done, as he was showing the incoming unit their patrol areas. Suck it up!

I've never run that far before in go, as I am a noob, but 150 burpee pull-ups will make my past work outs look like warm ups. in comparison

I cannot wait to do this.

This workout has come on a very special day in Australian history, for today is remembrance day. On this day we remember our fallen service heroes

It breaks my heart every time I do a hero wod.

This will be epic.
Comment #28 - Posted by: Boris at November 10, 2012 9:59 PM

Sunday musings…

1) Obfuscate. To lie, just better dressed.

2) Veteran’s Day. Today we remember all of those who have served our country in the Armed Forces. Or, do we? Think about it…when is the last time you actually thought about what it meant for someone you know or knew to serve in our military? Your Dad, an uncle, your sister, or the couple across the street who are now wearing Dockers instead of Dress Blues. All of the CrossFitters who will retire this year, like Paul, Andy, Tosh.

What sort of recognition do you really have of their service? How exactly will you express that?

3) Childhood. Mrs. bingo and I used to whisper in our children’s ear each night: “you’re having a happy childhood.” They have no memory of these whispered exhortations, but they did have very happy childhoods, indeed.

When does childhood end? It’s certainly not the beginning of school. Judging by my experiences it most certainly isn’t in college, either! Perhaps it’s that first job, or the first time you pay the rent out of your own checkbook, or pull out a couple of bucks to tip whoever. The birth of your first child is certainly a wake-up call; maybe that’s when your own childhood concludes. Mrs. bingo and I always said we’d consider ourselves grown-ups when we owned our own washer and dryer.

Could it be, though, that childhood never ends? I think of friends, a few much older patients, others who have never lost that child-like sense of wonder at the world around them. For sure, some folks are forced to grow up much too quickly and take on the responsibilities we associate with the end of childhood when the calendar says that they are much too young to be considered an adult. But is even their childhood truly over?

All childhood really does end, of course. We do, eventually, all move on to something that looks like all grown up. But our childhood remains there for us, all of the wonder of discovery, all of the memories, all of the people who brought us up. It’s all still there, ready to be called upon when we need a little boost, when we need to remember who and why we are, to feel again what it felt like to have few responsibilities and fewer cares. It gets a little better as we get a little older, too, doesn’t it? Childhood memories seem to be wired that way.

You are never too old to have a happy childhood.

I’ll see you next week...

HOW??? A while back I did the 100 burpee pull ups and I couldn't move for the next couple of days. This looks insane. I'd like to try it, but I'm not sure that I'd have the time to complete it.
Comment #34 - Posted by: brad at November 11, 2012 1:22 AM

don't be dumb about this WOD if you need to scale it then scale it thats what CrossFit is all about maybe do half maybe do 3/4 who knows do what your body can do dont push to be injured and don't listen to the people saying if you can't do it then your weak minded because thats not the answer either. train smart and hard not stupid and dangerous. for the record ill be doing 4 miles to 100 burpees
Comment #35 - Posted by: joel at November 11, 2012 1:47 AM

POSITIVE. Find it people, find it. The beautiful thing about us, is that its already innately in there. We need only to find it & pull it out. MUCH RESPECT TO OUR FALLEN HEROES.

5 miles, 150 burpee pull -ups

Comment #48 - Posted by: ART/M/44/5'5"/148 at November 11, 2012 5:53 AM

44/m/176cm/73kg

5 rounds for time

row 2k
30 burpee pull-ups

1:05.19

rest 7 minutes to to change clothes for running outside.

run 6k

31:40

Total time (including 7 min rest) 1:43:59

I don't have a pull-up bar outside high enough for burpee pull-ups and it was pouring down this morning too. So I decided to row 2k pieces and do the burpee pull-ups at home. Meanwhile the rain had stopped and I added a 6k run to go the full distance.

I have to admit, this wasn't so bad at all. I actually quite enjoyed the run and was able to go faster towards the end. Blood blisters on my fingers from the burpee pull-ups will remind of this WOD the next couple of days.

At the end of the day it feels better to say I did it rather than I gave up or did not try.

THIS WILL BE MY 2ND WOD EVER!! And nothing like jumping right in!!! I am pumped for the challenge!!

Are there any pointers anyone can give me regarding crossfit in general? I'm 6'0 200lbs and have been so consumed with the generic lifting techniques that I've almost forgotten how to work at a HI like this? Anyone?:)

Comment #60 - Posted by: John Pavlic at November 11, 2012 8:53 AM

Nick,

Welcome to crossfit. I would recommend first learning perfect technique on all lifts if you have not already. If your following th main site know when to scale. Most important is nutrition. You will never outrain bad nutrition. There r a lot of good resources on this site regarding proper nutrition for crossfit.
Comment #61 - Posted by: Hollyhog at November 11, 2012 8:59 AM

For those who come out of this having difficulty moving, or concern that you will be in that condition tomorrow and days to follow, I highly recommend you head over to CrossFit Endurance and check out the "strength and conditioning recovery wod." Concept is you do it 10 minutes after this workout and do it again everyday that follows until you feel relatively normal. Good luck all and thanks to B-Mac for the S&CR program design element.

A heartfelt thank you to the mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, and of course children, who have ever been asked to wave goodbye to their loved ones as they head out to the fight on our behalf.

To all who have worn the military uniform, my sincere thanks.

Bingo,

Thanks for all your musings - they are a delight to read and ponder about and you give words to some feelings and thoughts that I have a hard time expressing. I especially like the one where you talk about the worth of a friend and how you are the one getting the most out of a dinner or something even though you pay for it.
My unit encourages us MIDN to think about the meaning of these days and I have been wondering what a good way to honor Veteran's Day would be. Many ideas come to mind but in the end I settled on this. Give friends a call/email who are in the military and express thanks. Go for a run with mom and appreciate having family and friends and the happiness and blessings I have in my life due to these extraordinary men and women. Thank a stranger. Hit a CF hero workout hard tomorrow.
Thanks for also being a motivator/role model in CF and in life. Looking forward to entering into the medical field after college. Enjoy the day.
Best, rh

Hey guys, great WOD today... I've been doing CrossFit for two months, and I have to admit, this was the toughest WOD yet. I'm happy this came up today, because it helped me understand that the tough is still there. I had to scale down to 5K run and 100 burpee pull-ups. I did vomit today, but most importantly, I'm so happy that tomorrow is rest day.... Thank you all from CrossFit for your posts- you guys are all my motivation. Today is rememberence day in Canada, and today's WOD Was a tribute to all the soldiers who served.

GREAT WOD!!

Did this WOD in full gear, minus my helmet. 27 degrees outside, so the running was terrible.

Did 5x 2 miles/30 burpee pull ups.

I decided to break this up to 1 mile 15 burpee pull ups for 10 rounds. The best route I could configure where I would end at the pull up bar was a little longer than a mile so in the end according to my running app I did 12.47 miles and 150 burpee pull ups in 1:58:08. My knee is killing me today but this was a small sacrifice to make in comparison to what our veterans have and continue to sacrifice.
