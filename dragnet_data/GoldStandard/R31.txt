Look!

Did you know 'look' was the first word I ever read from a school book? I actually remember bringing home a book called 'Look', each page contained a different scene from a zoo and just the solo word Look. The next week the next book in the series continued along the look theme but introduced a few other words such as 'a', 'the', 'at' and 'it'. That was well over 25 years ago and I remember it clear as day, it's funny what you remember isn't it?

Anyway, I'm stretching my 'Look' memory a bit by relating it to some exciting news. I'm in Look Magazine this week. A couple of weeks back I was interviewed about running a money saving blog and living a thrifty life - I expected it to be a few short snippets but it turns out I have a whole page dedicated to my damn face. Cool huh? I share some of my favourite money saving tips along with some of my charity shop location and timing secrets.

Professionally I'm lucky enough to have my worked featured in the press on a regular basis however whenever my blog is featured in a magazine or newspaper the excitement whizzes through me a lot faster and I make bizarre noises. My blog is my love, my baby. We go through ups and downs but ultimately I love my blog. A huge thank you to everyone who stops by to read because you've made my blog go further than I could ever have imagined. THANK YOU!

This edition of the magazine, which is their Style Savvy issue, came out on Tuesday and will be available here in the UK on the shelves of your trusty local newsagent until next Monday.

TTFN,

P.S. By the way if anyone can track down this book or point me in the direction of it that would be fantastic and I'll love you forever. It was an official school book from a reading scheme rather than just a story book for children. I read it in school when I was about 3 or 4 so that would have been 1986/87.

My brother learnt to read with the 'Look' book! My mum was so proud when he started reading the word off the road (look left etc) as he'd been struggling with reading. Well done on the mag article :)

I have no recollection of this Look book of which you speak, I am a girl of the Village with Three Corners.......Roger Red Hat, Billy Blue Hat and Johnny and Jennifer Yellow hat. Oxford reading tree has NOTHING on that ;)

    Oh my word you just took me straight back to my sons school reading books, I really loved those, (eeek showing my age), they didn't have these when my daughter came along and I can't remember hers (does that say something about me or that particular reading scheme!!).
