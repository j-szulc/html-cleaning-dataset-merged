Can Mashable’s Apple Fangirl Switch to the Lumia 920?
 November 12, 2012 by Christina Warren


Is it possible for a dyed-in-the-wool iPhone user to switch to another platform, say Windows Phone 8, full-time? I’m about to find out.

Beginning Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2012, I will be making Nokia’s Lumia 920 my primary (read: only) phone for 10 days.

To keep things fair, I’m going to be giving up my iPhone 5. It won’t even be in my possession — I’ll leave it locked away at work where I won’t be able to touch it or play with it. I’m even going to forward my Verizon phone number to AT&T for 10 days. I’m going all in.

To say I’m invested in the iOS ecosystem would be an understatement. Since 2008, I’ve downloaded or purchased 945 apps. More than that, I’m a Mac user. My calendars, contacts, iMessage lists and browser bookmarks are all part of the Apple ecosystem. Moving to another platform is a big step.

I’ll be chronicling the entire process here on Mashable with video and text entries each day.
Why?

So why am I doing this? For science, of course! In truth, I want to give Windows Phone 8 and its flagship device, the Lumia 920, a real test from the perspective of someone who is a power user on another platform.

Usually, when I review a phone, I still have my main daily driver in my pocket. As a result, it’s harder for me to get a consistent feel for the day-to-day aspects of the OS, the app ecosystem and the various pleasures and pratfalls of using the phone.

I often write about must-have apps — but when push comes to shove, what apps really matter the most? Can I live without Instagram? Are there apps that will let me access my drafts in Dropbox? Will I be able to access my passwords and authenticate my two-auth logins? Is there an easier way to manage four distinct mail accounts?

In short, I want to do exactly what Nokia is encouraging users to do — I want to “Switch to Lumia” and give a long, fair look at how it fits with my life.
Stay Tuned

Stay tuned to Mashable and my Twitter account (@film_girl) to follow my process. In the meantime, let me know what you’d like me to test on the Lumia 920 and what questions you have about Windows Phone 8.

If you’re a longtime Windows Phone 8 user, what apps should I download first to aid in my transition? Sound off in the comments!

I think you’ll have trouble finding any “long term Windows Phone 8 Users” considering it’s pretty young :)

I’ve been a WP7 user for about a year now, Most of the apps I use daily are built in. I have a separate live tile for each of my 4 primary e-mail accounts, plus a live tile for my family members, a different one for my friends I keep in touch with most frequently, a live tile for my grocery list in OneNote for quick updates, a pictures live tile, Xbox Live tile, and my favorite playlist for quick access to music on the go.

A few apps you will want to look at include: Ask Ziggy as a Siri replacement, Connectivity Shortcuts as a quick way to turn wifi and bluetooth on and off, Curbside Food if you’re a fan of food trucks, and 4th & Mayor is better than the official 4Square app (if you use that). You should also check out Wordament, a great boggle type game where you play against the world!

I have well over 150 apps and games installed, so this is a quick list of what I like. Hope it’s helpful! Hope you enjoy your Lumia experience :)

Perhaps for an apples to apples comparison (pun intended) you may want to try of the smaller lighter phones like the 810 or 820. The 920 is feature packed but coming from an iPhone 5, I’m thinking the extra heft would be noticeable.
