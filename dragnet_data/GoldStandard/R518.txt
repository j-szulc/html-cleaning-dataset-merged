Matt Ryan focused on Falcons record, not MVP race

Leading the Atlanta Falcons to an 7-0 has garnered quarterback Matt Ryan a whole lot of attention, especially for those to engage in early season MVP discussions.

Ryan dropped by Wednesday’s edition of “NFL AM” to discuss the Falcons hot start, his teammates’ play and his Halloween plans. He also deflected questions about any potential MVP trophy ending up in his trophy cabinet.

“I think through the first half of the season I’ve done some things well, certainly played winning football and that is what it’s all about,” he said. “I don’t worry about comparing myself to other guys and how I stack up against them I just try and do my best and try to put in a winning effort in every week.”
