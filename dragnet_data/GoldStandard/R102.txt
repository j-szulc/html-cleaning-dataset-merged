Onion and Ricotta Frittata
October 28, 2012

I’m here to be your I-Totally-Don’t-Need-To-Go-Out-To-Brunch-Because-I’m-My-Own-Awesome-Brunch-Cook cheerleader.

Not everything needs to be yeasted, decadent, and totally over the top.  Not every brunch meal needs to be enjoyed only standing on a sidewalk for an hour.  Promise.

I made this simple frittata with Emily from Cupcakes and Cashmere last week.  We also shared Chai-Spiced Cinnamon Rolls which are, admittedly, a bit of an ordeal to make.  This frittata is the opposite of an ordeal.  It’s pure, simple, savory goodness.

Last week:  brunch with Emily in Los Angeles.  This week:  hurricane in Baltimore with friends, wine, and Halloween decorations.  You know… the usual.

Yea.  Hurricane… my California veins don’t even know what that word means.

Emily cracking eggs.  I love the blurry, pinky up, diamond sparkle.

The discard pile.

What I super love about this recipe is the onion.  As soon as you put onion in a hot pan with olive oil… game over… it smells like you’re a pro.

Another reason to love this recipe, onions are sliced… no crazy cry-chopping.  Slice em… get in and get out.

Herbs are essential.

Parsley is a go-to.  I add it to most everything by the handful.  I also had rosemary and thyme on hand.  A rough chop and in they go!

Giant dollops of whole-milk ricotta cheese are added to the onion-y, herb-y eggs.

Emily made Bloody Marys while the frittata baked.

Pepper heavy.

And Emily totally made this sparkle tray herself.  Naturally.

The easiest Onion and Ricotta Frittata, spicy Bloody Marys (Geoffrey totally washed his hands before digging into the ice cubes), and Chai-Spiced Cinnamon Rolls.

This Onion and Ricotta Frittata is so satisfying because it’s made out of items that you can most likely find in your fridge on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  The onions are savory and fragrant.  The herbs are fresh and bright.  The ricotta cheese is beautifully creamy and the perfect complement to the cooked eggs.  If your instinct is to add sautéed mushrooms or spicy sausage to this frittata, I would say ‘right-on right-on’!

Onion and Ricotta Frittata

makes one 9-inch frittata

adapted from Epicurious

3 tablespoons olive oil

1 medium yellow onion, sliced thin

8 large eggs

1/2 cup heavy cream (or whole milk is great too)

2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary

2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme

1/4 cup  chopped fresh parsley

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper

1/2 cup whole-milk ricotta

Place rack in center of the oven and preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Heat oil in a 9-inch, oven proof skillet over medium heat.  Add sliced onions and saute until browned and cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes.  While onions are cooking, in a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, fresh herbs , salt and pepper.

When the onions are done cooking, reduce heat to low.  Add the egg mixture and allow to cook and set over low heat, about 8 minutes.  Dollop ricotta over eggs in six dollops.  Place frittata in the oven to finish baking.  Bake for 10 minutes, or until eggs are set and no longer giggle in the center.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve warm or at room temperature.

saw this delicious spread over on cupcakes and cashmere a few days ago and can’t wait to try out your rolls. am i a freak that i’m loving the pan you cooked/served in?

Alison October 28, 2012 at 8:03 pm

This looks delicious and I can’t wait to make it. I may need to make it while I’m trapped inside due to the hurricane…I think I have all the ingredients. I keep telling myself it won’t be as bad as they keep saying, but I think I might be wrong. Stay safe and enjoy your time in Baltimore. It’s a fun city.

Emily D. October 28, 2012 at 8:25 pm

I am digging the rhyme scheme this dish has got going on.

Miriam @ overtimecook October 28, 2012 at 8:30 pm

This looks delicious. I haven’t made frittata in forever- need to try this one!

Averie @ Averie Cooks October 28, 2012 at 8:33 pm

Gorgeous frittata and way to keep it lower work, lower effort, and high on taste. I have been loving my cast iron skillet lately for that very reason. Almost impossible to have something turn out badly and it’s so easy. The photos are gorgeous, Joy!

emmycooks October 28, 2012 at 8:55 pm

Ok, I love the frittata, but can I just point out that it is seriously genius to freeze tomato ice cubes for your bloody marys? I made bloody mary popsicles this summer and they were awesome.

Maggie @ A Bitchin' Kitchen October 28, 2012 at 9:10 pm

I definitely giggled at “or until eggs are set and no longer giggle in the center.” Heheh.

This frittata looks delicious!

Erica October 28, 2012 at 9:38 pm

I have recently become obsessed with ricotta cheese and I feel like this may be the ideal way to enjoy my new obsession. I can’t wait to give this a go.

Cookie and Kate October 28, 2012 at 9:44 pm

How much would I love to sit down to brunch with you ladies?! So much! This frittata looks fabulous. Hope the hurricane doesn’t come close! Drink up.

Kathleen @Ksugarandspice October 28, 2012 at 10:35 pm

Joy, shut up. Out of this world.

jaime @ sweet road October 28, 2012 at 10:42 pm

This frittata looks amazing, but honestly the part of this post that caught my attention the most was the bloody mary ice cubes. What a great idea to avoid watering down the drinks! It’s so simple, but apparently I haven’t thought of it yet…

Jamie @ green beans & grapefruit October 28, 2012 at 11:03 pm

Ricotta in/on/under eggs is a personal favorite combo- and yes- herbs make it all so wonderful!! This looks so good- you’re a rock star cheerleader!

Sofia October 28, 2012 at 11:57 pm

Hmmm I don’t have ricotta but I do have goat cheese. Let the subs begin!

Maria @ Cheeky Pink Tulip October 29, 2012 at 12:37 am

Great frittata combo! Looks like you guys had an awesome time – totally loving it.

I’m thinking brie, chopped tomatoes, ham, cilantro frittatas… And I have all them ingredients for a beautiful brunch tomorrow. oh my… Thanks for the inspiration!

It is amazing to me how people from the east coast are terrified of earthquakes. I would much rather be in an earthquake than a hurricane or tornado! I guess it shows that we are all afraid of the unknown. YIKES!!!

Margherita October 29, 2012 at 2:56 am

The frittata looks amazing but what about those chia-spiced cinnamon rolls I see in the background kind of steal the spotlight (I made them yesterday and they’re so incredibly good!)

The Savory and The Beautiful October 29, 2012 at 3:40 am

I love that you can dump practically anything in a frittata and it still sounds gourmet…lol I made a similar one yesterday sans the ricotta, but i’ll have to give it a try. Be safe chica!

Heather October 29, 2012 at 4:33 am

Oooooooh. Frittata. I was feeling very brunch-ey yesterday. The breakfast restaurant scene here is majorly disappointing. I made Apple Pie Scones. Wish I’d had this then! For dinner, perhaps.

gayle October 29, 2012 at 5:11 am

Frittata is, to use an Alton Brown term, “refrigerator velcro”. Meaning you can throw pretty much anything that’s been hanging out in your frig into it. Cooked noodles? Yes. Stir fry veggies? Yes. Ends of cheeses? Yes. You get my drift. :)

Bakerkat October 29, 2012 at 5:44 am

This looks so good.
I’m in Hurricane country, I felt a bit of pre-storm jitters yesterday so I baked Vegan pumpkin bread with pecans and the day before I made Honey muffins. They’ll make good treats while we wait out the storm.

Julie October 29, 2012 at 5:44 am

I love when my eggs giggle.

Jodie October 29, 2012 at 5:52 am

Ooo, loves amazing!

Abby@ Totes Delish October 29, 2012 at 6:09 am

Ohh so simple and comforting, love it!

Jessica October 29, 2012 at 6:33 am

Joy, this sounds delish!! I can’t wait to try. And thanks for posting a variety of recipes. This GF girl appreciates it!

Erin  The Law Students Wife October 29, 2012 at 7:34 am

Frittatas are one of my fave brunch additions for every reason you shared. So satisfying, simple, and everyone gets to enjoy their eggs at once, vs. having to wait for individual omelets. I’ve never tried adding ricotta, but it looks creamy and wonderful!

Kitchen Mommy October 29, 2012 at 7:46 am

Looks delish! I LOVE the way your whole table looks, too.

Terri October 29, 2012 at 8:04 am

Joy, everything is sooooooo beautiful, the food and the table. Table looks amazing.

Ashley @ Wishes and Dishes October 29, 2012 at 8:39 am

I’m stuck inside due to the hurricane and need to make this now!!

Nicole @ Lapetitebaker October 29, 2012 at 9:17 am

I love frittatas! And the combination of onions and riccota sound delicious.

Stay safe in Baltimore!

Samantha October 29, 2012 at 10:07 am

So, I just realized last week that a frittata is a quiche without the crust. So, not only are you skipping a major step, it’s fewer calories/more protein per bite. Consequently, I’m thinking I’m switching from being Quiche Lady to Frittata Freak. At least until I’m no longer Thick in the Middle of Fall. Thanks for that little push!

Hope you enjoy the storm. I witnessed 3 tornados in my 1st summer outside of California (in Michigan) and LOVED it. SO exciting!! Who knew storm clouds came in army green?!?

Katrina @ Warm Vanilla Sugar October 29, 2012 at 10:13 am

what a fab recipe, joy!
