Elektron makes button-heavy synths and samplers, it also makes great teaser videos. If you needed any proof, then its newest offering, Analog Four (and accompanying video), should be plenty. This time, we have a little exclusive advanced info to go with it. The latest box of sonic tricks is a four voice analog synth (with two analog oscillators each), comes with an internal step-sequencer, plus multiple LFOs and the usual array of filters and effects. One other nice addition is the inclusion of CV/Gate and DIN outputs, meaning you can also control some of those older pre-MIDI synths you might have lying around (there is MIDI functionality too, of course). There's also a live performance mode, so you can shake up the pattern on the fly, along with other creative tools like arpeggio toggling. Features are all good and well, but what does it sound like? Well, head past the break for a demo, plus that extravagant teaser vid. If, however, you were sold at "four voice analog synth," keep your eyes (and filters) open for December 3rd availability
