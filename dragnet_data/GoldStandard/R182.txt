{SavourTheSeason} Days 29, 30 & 31: Maple Pecan Pumpkin Pie 

This pie counts as three days of the 31 Days of Autumn.  Because it's that good, but also because I need a break. I am tired from baking and crafting and cooking and tending to sick babies and nesting like crazy because this little babe in my womb is due in only 5 weeks.  Where did the time go? 

So please forgive me for cheating a little on my 31 days series.  And enjoy this Maple Pecan Pumpkin Pie recipe!

Start with your favourite pie crust.  I've shared my real butter pie crust recipe before in this post.

In a food processor or blender,mix together:

    3/4 cup of brown sugar
    1/4 cup of real maple syrup
    1/2 tsp salt
    1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
    2 eggs
    1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree

Add:

     1/2 cup milk combined with 1/2 cup heavy cream

Pour filling into pie crust.

Put pie on a cookie sheet and use tinfoil to cover your pie edges so that they don't burn.

Bake at 400 degrees for the first 20 minutes and then turn the heat down to 350 degrees and cook another 30 minutes or until the filling has puffed up and is no longer wet to the touch but still jiggly, if that makes sense.

While pie is baking, make the pecan topping. In a food processor, crumble together:

    2 Tbsp butter
    1 Tbsp grated orange zest
    1/4 cup brown sugar
    1 cup pecan halves

Spread the pecan topping on the top of the pie and cook for 10 more minutes. 

Remove pie from oven and cool completely, ideally overnight.  Don't get impatient on this.  All of my pumpkin pie failures have always been because I thought I could rush things and slice the pie while it is still warm.  Make your pumpkin pie a day ahead to let the flavour and texture develop as it cools completely!

How do you keep your brown sugar from going hard? I've been trying out different containers lately, but haven't found one I like yet.

    I just buy a brand that comes in a big zip-top bag. The zip-top keeps it fresh!

    We always put a slice of bread in it.. I have no idea why it's just what my grandma did!

    We either put bread slices or jumbo marshmallows in ours. Keeps ot nice and soft!

    I always keep mine in a mason with a tight sealing lid. . . Works like a charm, I actually forgot one of my jars once about 6 months later it was still soft . . . And when it gets hard you can always steam it back into softness

Yummmmmm. This looks delicious. I have never made a pumpkin pie but this recipe looks both delicious and easy (two of my most compelling reasons to bake!) Hope all goes well as you near the end of another pregnancy.
Keep up the God work.

Do you refrigerate the pie overnight or let it sit out at room temperature?

    KellyOctober 29, 2012 3:16 PM

    Either, depending on if I have the fridge space or not.

Thank you for a wonderful series!
It was refreshing to see all the wonderful, traditional ways to enjoy fall without spending big bucks on going to corn mazes or the like.


I'm sad to see the series end but so thankful to have it bookmarked for future reference! I too am about ready to end my series - but I'm glad I did it!

How would this taste without the nut layer? Would it be OK as a stand alone maple pumpkin pie? We have some friends/family with severe nut allergies, but the pumpkin portion sounds scrumptious! Thanks for this fabulous series; I've enjoyed it very much.

    I adapted the recipe from a plain pumpkin pie recipe...so i suppose it would be fine. I don't particularly like ordinary pumpkin pie, so that's why I add the nut layer.

    If you try it,let me know how it turns out!
