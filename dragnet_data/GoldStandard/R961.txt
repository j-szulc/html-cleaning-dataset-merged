By Haje Jan Kamps

To celebrate the launch of Michael Freeman’s latest book, his publisher Ilex are hosting a special live tonight at 6.00pm British time (use this handy converter to find out what time it will be for you).

Freeman will give a talk explaining the book’s concept and share a few stories about his years as a professional assignment photographer, and then you'll be able to join in the discussion via twitter and a live discussion board, for an interactive masterclass -- completely for free!

I'll be there for sure - what about you?
