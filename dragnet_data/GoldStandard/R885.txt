Words with Friends and Draw Something may not be new games, but I bet they are still pretty popular. If you recently got your hands on a Windows Phone device and are looking for some fun, these games have finally made their way onto Windows Phone.

Better late than never, right? These games should give you hours of fun. I guess itâ€™s good to see that major titles are making their way onto the Windows Phone platform, even if it is later than on other platforms.

If you have a Windows Phone device, you can find Words with Friends or Draw Something at the Windows Phone Store.
