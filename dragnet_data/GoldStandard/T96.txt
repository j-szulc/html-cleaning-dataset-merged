The Hyundai Elantra: 2012 North American Car of The Year

By Logan Utsman on Monday, January 9th, 2012
For the past nineteen years, a jury of expert automotive journalists get together with one very tough goal to accomplish: determine which car is worthy of an exceedingly prestigious award.  Each candidate for the North American Car of The Year trophy must be new as well as innovative, impactful, satisfying to drive, hold excellent value for the money spent and carry a level of design, safety and handling to make the car memorable.  After the carefully selected panel of judges narrowed down more than 50 entries to just three competitors, a final winner was selected.  Beating both the 2012 Volkswagen Passat and Ford Focus and earning the title “2012 North American Car of The Year” is the Hyundai Elantra.

“In a year with some truly breakthrough competitors, we are honored that the jury recognizes Elantra’s far-reaching impact on the industry,” said  John Krafcik, President and CEO for Hyundai Motor America.  The first compact car to adopt Hyundai’s ‘Fluidic Design’ philosophy that spawned the Sonata and Genesis model line, the Elantra is an inexpensive, efficient and tidy car that doesn’t necessarily look the part.  Envisioned by Hyundai’s North American Design in Irvine, California, the Elantra a remarkably low drag coefficent (.28) meaning that not only is it attractive, but it slices through the air with ease.  Add this to the efficient 1.8 liter inline four cylinder and 40 mpg can be achieved without the help of hybrid assists.  In 2011 alone, the little Hyundai became rather popular earning a total of 186,361 sales and with its new found swagger as North American Car of The Year, the Elantra should cruise effortlessly through the new year.
