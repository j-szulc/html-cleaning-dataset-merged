How to Make Giant, Illuminated Balloon Art

Here’s a superb way to get a message across: This giant Super Mario “sculpture” is made up of hundreds of LED Floaties (Helium + LEDs + Balloons).  Of course, the idea can be altered to fit any graphic or message – All you need is a grid for color placement and you’re set to go!  Check out the video:

The process begins with colored LEDs and 3-volt coin batteries.  One LED is taped to one battery, placed into an opaque balloon, helium is added, and finally the balloons are attached to a “grid” comprised of carbon fiber tubes.  Once all the balloons are in place, the entire apparatus is tethered to the ground and allowed to float over your city for everyone to admire.  Read the complete instructions to create your own!
