BOISBRIAND, Quebec -- Halifax Mooseheads left wing Jonathan Drouin, one of the top prospects for the 2013 NHL Draft, will not play for the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League team against Team Russia in Game 1 of the Subway Super Series on Monday (7 p.m. ET, NHLN-US, Sportsnet) due to a foot injury.

Drouin, 17, suffered the injury Saturday blocking a shot in the Mooseheads' 5-1 win at the Drummondville Voltigeurs. He played in Halifax's 6-5 shootout loss at the Rimouski Oceanic on Sunday, which snapped the Mooseheads' 14-game winning streak, but was limited to spot duty because of the injury.

Mooseheads general manager Cam Russell told the Halifax Chronicle-Herald that Drouin suffered a bruise and added that it was possible he would play in Game 2 of the series, Wednesday night in Val-d'Or, Quebec.

Drouin missed six games earlier this season with an undisclosed upper-body injury. In 12 games this season, the 5-10.75, 185-pound forward has 11 goals and 13 assists. He is listed as an A skater on NHL Central Scouting's preliminary rankings of players to watch for this year's draft.

Drouin's teammate and fellow top 2013 draft prospect goaltender Zachary Fucale also won't play for Team QMJHL on Monday. However, he is expected to play Wednesday in Val-d'Or after playing in back-to-back games over the weekend.

Val-d'Or Foreurs defenseman Matt Murphy, listed as a C skater in Central Scouting's preliminary rankings, also will miss Monday's game for Team QMJHL but will play in front of his home crowd Wednesday.
