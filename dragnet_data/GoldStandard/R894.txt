New 30 day challenge: get good sleep

by Matt Cutts on November 1, 2012

in 30 days

For October 2012, I tried to practice the ukulele every day. I ended up doing more traveling than I expected, but I managed to play ukulele most of the days. I’m still a total beginner, but it was a lot of fun! My favorite song to play so far is M.T.A. by the Kingston Trio. My Dad used to play that sometimes as I was growing up.

For November 2012, I mentioned to my wife that I was thinking of trying to get good sleep this month, like eight hours a night. My wife’s reaction could be categorized as skeptical at best. Which just makes me want to do it, of course. :)

So I’m setting a goal of eight hours of sleep a night for the next 30 days. We’ll see how it goes! If you want more context, here’s what I mean when I talk about 30 day challenges:

Why not think about something that sounds like fun, or that you’ve wanted to start, and give it a shot for the next 30 days?

    Such a great idea Matt I’m going to do something maybe sleep for 30 days. I suggested to my kids they clean their room for 30 days got some funny looks, I think your idea of taken a photo for 30 days might be better for them.

    From experience, your body will surely thank you, and your mind will be sharper too. Make this change permanent.

    8 hours of sleep in 2012 and upcoming years is quite a deal, officials, working person and especially when someone connected to Google in any way cannot sleep more than 6 hours..Lol and these days with too much of updates, I don’t want to experience nightmare while sleeping…

    Well, best of luck… sweet dreams.

    Matt, there is a truism that it takes 21 days to form a habit. How many of your 30 day challenges have become habits? Any?

    Sleep tight!

    (If you like Charley on the MTA, you must get this Pete Seeger album: http://www.amazon.com/Abiyoyo-Other-Story-Songs-Children/dp/B000001DM6 . I actually got my kids to brush their teeth by substituting “Brushy Brushy Brushy” for “Sweepy Sweepy Sweepy”. The songs are good for adults as well as kids.)

    If you have problems sleeping, just read some “website reinclusion” requests. That will do the trick :.)

    I have a one-month-old baby at home, so I will join you in spirit. Get some sleep for the rest of us.

    Hi Matt,

    This is something that you have inspired me even before the TED video released. I tried following your steps like daily exercise, counting calories, reading a chapter a day, and more. Thank you novelist.

And cheers for your new resolution :D Sleep more and put less time on EMD updates, Panda updates and penguins :D God bless :)

    Matt,
    A truly inspirational speech. Indeed, the hardest challenge faced by the entire population of the earth is the inability or unwillingness to break an addiction or change our day to day routines. By setting these small 30 day goals, we begin to re train our subconscious. Our confidence grows rapidly and we manifest all kinds of other positive habits. If people take your advice and actually carry out a mini 30 day challenge, amazing transformational things will happen in their life. Once we start achieving goals or completing challenges, our brain turns on the electricity in all kinds of places. (sometimes for the first time). Thanks for sharing and keep up the great work you doing for the web community.

    Can’t recommend Sleep Cycle (app store) enough, both the sympathetic alarm (wakes you when you’re in light sleep rather than at Time X) and the data gathering sides of it.

    Talked to my hubby about this. You can guess what his suggestion was to try to do every day for 30 days. Typical man.
