Extend Your Battery Life - Energy Saver

Some Nokia users may complaint about the battery life. This application will you help to increase your battery life.

Application gives you a calendar and you can define “Switch Off”, “Switch On” days and times. By this way you are not loosing battery life on sleeping times

The developer of this applications says that; “Extend your battery charge up to 30% by switching off your smartphone for the night”.

If It’s true, extending %30 battery life is perfect. That means you have to charge your phone more seldom. I Have installed and tried Energy Saver on my Nokia E65 and It worked successfully.

This application is coming with 14 days trial version
