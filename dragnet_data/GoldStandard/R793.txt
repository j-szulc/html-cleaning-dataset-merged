Biscuit Home Boutique Launches
Drool-worthy bedding at your fingertips

Sheets shopping can be a snooze.

Biscuit Home dreams of revving up your bedtime routine without breaking your budget.

Texas decorator Bailey McCarthy launched the home decor site with the help of pals Christina Ducruet and textile designer Isabel Wilson, who turns out punchy-meets-preppy duvet and linen patterns (available in sizes twin to king), each inspired by a special someone in the ladiesâ€™ lives.

Sleep tight in a paint-splattered motif dedicated to fellow decor guru Jamie Meares. Doze on a cheeky bike print for Cup of Jo blogger/cycling enthusiast Joanna Goddard. Or stretch out on elegant flat sheets trimmed in colors like chartreuse and lilac.

That should wake things up.

Available at biscuit-home.com, $30-$300. DailyCandy readers receive 20 percent off with code candy at checkout through November 16.
