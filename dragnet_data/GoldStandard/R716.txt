GOProud Suddenly Believes That The GOP Should Support Same-Sex Marriage

After endorsing numerous virulently anti-gay GOP candidates, including Romney, who signed a hate pledge to ban same-sex marriage via the federal constitution, GOProud's Jimmy LaSalvia has suddenly decided that Republicans should start backing gay unions.

RELATED: GOProud's 2012 endorsees did not fare very well. Aside from the incumbents who were in zero danger of being unseated, the majority of GOProud's endorsement roster went down in flames.  I believe the hashtag for this would be #GOProudKissOfDeath.
