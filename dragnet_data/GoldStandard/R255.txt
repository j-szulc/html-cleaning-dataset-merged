Badass Chicks: 12 Women Superheroes Drawn In Pin-Up Style

We write a lot about superheroes on Bit Rebels, and almost every time I read or write one of those articles, I wonder why there aren’t more prominent women superheroes. Sure, there are some classics like Wonder Woman, but overall, the superhero world is dominated by men. As we’ve seen in some non-superhero movies over the past several years, women can kick ass just as much as men. But still, for whatever reason, women superheroes aren’t well represented. That is probably why I fell in love with this artistic collection of illustrations.

These women superheroes are part of a gallery called DC Heroes created by Japanese artist and deviantART user ~kit-kit-kit. He created each one of these DC women in a very unique way. They almost look like portraits from the 1950s, like pin-up art. Each superhero is drawn as if she’s posing for the picture, and each one is very simple and sexy. They aren’t bright or overbearing, and they are feminine and strong.

When thinking about women superheroes, what characteristics do you think would make up the perfect one? If there was going to be one woman who saved the world as we know it from all the destruction and misery, what would she look like? What superpowers would she have? Ohhh…This could be fun. All the men would underestimate her powers, and she’d show them all who is boss. Yeah, I’m getting carried away with this idea, but wouldn’t it be great? If you would like to see more of Kit’s collection of illustrations (there are many more), just click over to the gallery on his deviantART page. He’s full of imagination, and he obviously knows the power of women superheroes. Catwoman (the last image below) is my favorite out of all these. Nice job!
