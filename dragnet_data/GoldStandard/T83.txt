Audi City, the brand’s premium shopping experience in London is now open and hoping to capitalize on the in-style idea of boutique car shopping.

With product experts and a “customer relationship manager” on hand, the set of stores will offer a selection of Audi’s in person to touch and test, but the full range will be there in virtual form. As the clip below shows, that means having a massive, interactive screen to offer as close to the real thing as possible without the same space demands as a traditional dealership.

BMW and Tesla have both already made similar moves to make their respective car buying experiences more fun and less intimidating, Audi is just the latest to the party.
