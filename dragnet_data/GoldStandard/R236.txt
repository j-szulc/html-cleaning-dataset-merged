Philip Karlberg makes watches cool, with nudes, for Plaza magazine
Posted by James Cartwright, Monday 05 November 2012 



How do you convince the public to buy an expensive watch? The standard method seems to be associating that watch with masculine pursuits and notoriously macho films stars. Travolta’s a pilot in his spare time and also owns a Breitling? I best get me one of those. Actually you know what, I’m more of a weekend motorbiking with George Clooney type, so make mine an Omega.

In fact I neither pilot nor motorbike and I don’t even own a watch, so the only way to appeal to my wallet is to drape these desirable time-pieces over nude porcelain models. It might not seem like an obvious way to market chronometers but that’s exactly what Philip Karlberg has done for the latest edition of Plaza magazine. Stunningly photographed and perched by the side of these fragile nudes the watches are refreshingly revealed for what they truly are – beautiful pieces of ornate design – instead of masquerading as an aspirational lifestyle choice. Although come to think of it, Clooney and I do have a lot in common…
