ALEC Baldwin‘s attention-seeking has allegedly upset the congregation of his local church.

The Hollywood actor is said to give very animated readings on Sundays when he attends Most Holy Trinity Parish in East Hampton, New York, which caused some parishioners to publicly show their disapproval of his behavior on July 29.

“Alec loves to be the center of attention and often reads from the pulpit, which really annoys some in the congregation,” a source said.

“It is so bad that, one recent Sunday, he went up to read, and part of the congregation stood and rudely turned their backs on him.”

“Even though he has generously given a lot of money to the town, there are people who just don’t like him. He has a need for attention and shows up at every event. When people go to the church, they don’t want to see the movie star up there.”
