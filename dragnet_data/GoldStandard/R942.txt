Parks and Recreation fans know that there’s no love lost between the public servants of the Parks department and those who work for the library — they think it’s the worst place in the world. “Pawnee’s library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I’ve ever seen,” Leslie Knope explained back in Season 2. “They’re like a biker gang. Only instead of shotguns and crystal meth, they use political savvy and shushing.” Considering this stated animosity for “punk-ass book jockeys,” you might find it surprising that Parks and Rec is no stranger to literary humor. Click through to enjoy a slideshow of some the show’s most notable bookish moments as illustrated exclusively for Flavorwire by Sky Friedlander.

This episode, in which Leslie authors a book on Pawnee, is understandably chock full of literary references, but this is our favorite. Manifestos?! If only we could get our hands on them.
