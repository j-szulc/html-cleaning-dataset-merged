Today, the Obama Administration announced a plan to create a national STEM Master Teacher Corps, which will recognize and reward 10,000 exceptional science, math, technology and engineering teachers in our nation’s classrooms. Educators who join the STEM Master Teachers Corps will make a commitment to champion the cause of STEM education in their respective communities, and will receive additional resources to mentor math and science teachers, inspire students, and help their communities grow

A world-class STEM workforce is essential to virtually every goal we have as a nation – whether it’s broadly shared economic prosperity, international competitiveness, a strong national defense, a clean energy future, and longer, healthier, lives for all Americans.  By creating a STEM Master Teaching Corps to inspire students, and by giving these educators the necessary resources to teach well, we are investing in America’s future.
