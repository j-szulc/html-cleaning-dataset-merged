Maybe. Didn't seem to work out so well for the Packers last year.

I know it's not their fault that the rest of the league sucks, but Atlanta has only beaten one team with a winning record, and that was the Broncos way back in week 2.

Does anyone else see them waltzing into the playoffs with ease and then going one-and-done?

If he gets a ring this year, I think he will. And he may anyway.

Great career, but nobody but Al Davis can live forever.

It's their history. Maybe next year they will draw some tougher competition--that would either help prepare them for the post-season, or show up the holes in their game.

You guys are acting like they got stomped or something.
It was a VERY close game, could have gone either ways.
Give some credit to the team and the coaching staff.
