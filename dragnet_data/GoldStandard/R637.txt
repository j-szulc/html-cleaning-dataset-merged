On Quadrille Today

Check out the homepage today at Quadrille, one of my go-to destinations for super chic fabric!

That's our old house up in Millerton, New York, featuring prints from Quadrille and custom lampshades from Susan Schneider of Shandell's. Do you remeber this stylish lamp she made for us from an old apothecary jar? The images are from our friend Celerie's book Black & White. If you missed our first post on her book with all of the photographs from our house, click here. Have a great weekend, everyone!
