LG 84-Inch 4K 3D TV

We don't know where you're going to find content to watch on it, but if you like to be as future-proof as possible with your purchases, it might be time to consider this LG 84-Inch 4K 3D TV ($20,000). Boasting a mammoth 84-inch, 3840 x 2160 4K — oh, sorry, it's "Ultra High Definition" now — panel, it also offers 3D technology, a new Magic Remote, Smart TV capabilities with access to over 1,400 apps, a 2.2 speaker system, and Dual Play, a new feature that lets gamers play head-to-head, full screen on the same screen.
