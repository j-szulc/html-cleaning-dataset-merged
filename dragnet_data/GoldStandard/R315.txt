Catholic churches install CCTVs



MANILA, Philippines - Aside from the all-seeing eyes of God, illegal activities inside churches would now be monitored by closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras.

The Church-run Radio Veritas reported security in some Catholic churches have been beefed up with the installation of CCTV cameras. This would serve as a preventive measure against crimes such as theft in the church premises.

Cubao Bishop Honesto Ongtioco said some of their parishes have already been fitted with remote-operated cameras.

“CCTV cameras are really helpful. In fact, some of our churches already have CCTVs at least in the convents and some important areas,” Ongtioco said.

“It’s necessary so that in case something happened, you can easily make a review and identify the perpetrators,” he said.

With this move, they would also be complying with the Quezon City government’s policy to install CCTV as a requirement for business permit by January 2013.

Ongtioco believes the new policy could help address increasing incidents of crime within the city, but to make it mandatory is another issue.

“To make it a requirement is another big issue. It should be discussed. It’s a good measure but then the important question is can everyone afford it, especially those with small business,” he said.
