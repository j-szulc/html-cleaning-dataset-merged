Egyptian Fury over Airstrikes and Firings

Egypt’s President Morsi, a former Muslim Brother, reacted resolutely to this week’s Sinai attacks, in which 16 Egyptian policemen were killed. As we noted earlier, the Egyptian military attacked unknown targets in Sinai from the air. Shortly thereafter, Morsi fired his intelligence chief, the commander of the military police, the head of the presidential guard, and the chief of Cairo security, among others. The heads are rolling in response to Egyptians’ anger over a lack of security and the apparent weakness of the government in Cairo.

But were these moves enough? Morsi was forced to stay away from a state funeral for the 16 slain Egyptian policemen, where mourners chanted slogans against him and the Brotherhood. His Prime Minister was forced to flee the mosque where the service was being held amid shouts of “You killed them, you dog!” and signs saying, ”This funeral is for Egyptians, not the Brotherhood and their president.”

Many Egyptians are clearly unhappy with the way the new government’s security record in the first weeks of its administration. Morsi has a lot work to do if he wants to avoid their wrath.
