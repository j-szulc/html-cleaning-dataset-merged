RIM Sees an Up Day After Setting BlackBerry 10 Launch Date

November 12, 2012 at 3:30 pm PT

Monday was a better day than usual on Wall Street for Research In Motion. The company’s shares rose more than 4 percent, briefly hitting $9.07 before closing at $8.81, after it announced a January 30, 2013, “launch event” for its first BlackBerry 10 devices. A nice rally for the long-suffering BlackBerry maker, which has seen its stock price fall 40 percent year-to-date amid continuing stumbles in the smartphone market.
