Give Back This Holiday Season!

We are really blessed to have had happy childhoods, full of themed parties, delicious home cooked foods and loving parents! But, not everyone has that luxury...and it really makes us sad. Can you imagine not recieving any gifts at Christmas as a child? Wouldn't you feel like Santa forgot about you? Well, we can't stand by and let that happen!


The nutty nomads recently volunteered at one of the Salvation Army's Toy Distribution Centers. Here, donated toys are sorted, prepared and shipped out to needy children in the United States. Volunteering is really a rewarding experience, even if it's doing the most menial tasks. Our job was to organize the toys into groups and prepare them for collection. It might seem silly, counting toys and boxing them up, but we felt like we were really making a difference. Some child somewhere was going to open the box that we made and be really happy on Christmas Day! One volunteer mentioned that he and his wife participated in this event every year, and out of all the years he's done this, this was by far the least amount of toys he's seen. This is a sign of the times, but we can still try and give what we can to those who really need it, whether it's canned food, your time, or using your own unique skills.


There are many organizations that have Holiday drives around this time of year. If you want to give back, find out about local charities. When we were younger, we helped out in a holiday soup kitchen at our church. Just taking an hour or so out of your day to help those in need can change someone's life and outlook on people! So, this Holiday Season, get into the true spirit of things by volunteering, donating or otherwise reaching out to your fellow man. You won't regret it!
