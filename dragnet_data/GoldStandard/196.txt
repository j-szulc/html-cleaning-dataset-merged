Students Read Hacker Monthly For Free
By Lim Cheng Soon, 14 November 2010

When a few students commented they wouldn't be able to afford Hacker Monthly, I could relate to that - as I was (and I'm sure many of you were) once a student too. So I've been giving away 1 year digital subscription plan to students who emailed about it since.

Today, I'm making it official. If you are still studying in college/university, you get to read Hacker Monthly for free by submitting your details thru this form.

If you feel like giving back, tell your fellow hackers and roommates about this. Thank you.
