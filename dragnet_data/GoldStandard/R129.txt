Hibu could be sued by some lenders over debt payment suspension

Yellow Pages firm owes £2bn as 2006 lenders threaten legal action over £65m of unpaid debts

Fallout continues at Hibu, aka Yell, aka Yellow Pages.

Last week the company behind the business directory announced it is stopping payments to its lenders as it gets to grip with its £2bn debt pile.

However, not all lenders are happy with this decision, and some are threatening to sue the company if they don't pay up the £65m owed from a 2006 loan which should have been paid back in full today.

Hibu said:

    The Group has now received correspondence from some members of the 2006 lenders that they may seek to launch litigious actions to recover amounts due to them (but unpaid as a result of the suspension of payment) under their facility (up to an aggregate of circa £65m). This may include a petition for the winding-up of the relevant borrowing entities. Hibu intends to deal with any amounts due under the 2006 facility as part of the overall restructuring process and does not believe that any legal action by any 2006 lender to recover such amounts has merit or should delay or significantly impede the broader restructuring process.

The company was also keen to point that the CoCom, which is owed £537.3m, is suitably happy to let Hibu suspend payments to it.

    The CoCom, which holds, manages or has a beneficial interest in c.24% (or £537.3m) of the debt under the 2009 facilities agreement (£2.279bn) has unanimously agreed to support these waivers, subject to credit committee approval.

Deciding against making the payments won't affect staff wages or the running of the company, for now at any rate.

    The Group retains healthy cash balances and therefore the decision is not driven by liquidity considerations, but rather a desire to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all financial lenders consistent with the overall balance sheet restructuring that is anticipated.
