Google's Voting Day Doodle

Google is not letting the current US presidential elections, which are underway, go unnoticed. While it's not getting involved politically, it is reminding people to vote via its most effective means, the homepage.

It's running an election-themed doodle in the US urging people to express their wishes.

It's not just a reminder, it's also a tool for finding polling stations near where you live. Clicking on the doodle leads you to a page that asks for your location.

In turn, you are provided with the nearby polling stations, as well as info such as voting laws in your location, what papers you need to vote and so on.

Google is hardly the only one doing something on Election Day; Twitter has an entire page dedicated to discovering the most useful tweets.
