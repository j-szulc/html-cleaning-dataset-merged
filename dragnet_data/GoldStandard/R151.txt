Advanced Battery Saver With 2 Licences

Advanced Battery Saver is one of the best solution to save your battery live. It’s coming with battery optimization models to extend your battery life.

The developer claim that it’s increasing your battery life up to %30. That sounds great! You may be curious about how this application saves battery. It closing some unnecessary applications like (Bluetooth, Sounds and Vibrations, Unnecessary service applications, Lights etc…)

It have 3 battery optimization modes; Basic saver, Saver off and Max Saver. You can also create a new mode in Options > Create New section.

- In Basic Saver Mode; Application is shutting down some “Battery Drainer” applications.
- In Max Saver Mode; Network Features, Bluetooth and Vibration is disabling automatically. That only allows you to use phone function. (That may be useful when you don’t have a charger on public places)

If you select saver off mode, It turns off power saving.

I also liked “When battery is” feature. It’s automatically enables saver when your battery is dropped under your defined level.

This application is Trial for 7 days. But don’t forget to write your comments with your e-mails. Because we will select randomly 2 lucky users and we will send them these licenses.

Results will be anounced on 25 March (Mails were sent to the winners)

Such application may come in handy if you are in a foreign city or a taking a long trip on the bike using GPS hoping that the battery will last enough

I wonder if it realy that good. It is not my first battery saver. There is a need to do a more fine tunning saving. Like: which application should be running when I am in a saving mode. Allow internet and saving at the same time.
