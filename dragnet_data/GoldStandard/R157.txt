Tuesday, October 23rd, 2012 Warning: This contains some gory and scary stuff!
Extreme Halloween Decor

This weekend I was heading over to take a walk on the newly paved Atlanta Beltline in Inman Park and passed by this insane Zombie house in the Old Fourth Ward. I stopped dead in my tracks, part scared, part in awe:

The way they were positioned, I felt I could practically see them staggering. Is this an homage to a famous scene in a zombie movie? Is the homeowner in charge of makeup or special effects for The Walking Dead (filmed here in A-town)? No one was around to ask, but I was seriously impressed.

The costumes were rather remarkable as well – they clothes are ragged, dirty, and not exactly stylin’.

I really don’t know what that gross red guy is about – some sort of tribute to Vlad the Impaler? The cast of  The Vampire Diaries only live a hop skip and a jump from this house, but this looked gorier than that show ever gets.

Where does one acquire all of these parts? The irony is, this is such a contemporary, unadorned, streamlined minimalist house; I imagine they have way more things in the front yard right now than they do in the entire interior!

I don’t think there’s any way I could go knock in this door if I were a trick-or-treater – could you?

How nuts do you go with the Halloween decorations? I have to admit I don’t even have a pumpkin going on at the moment. Do you have any houses in your neighborhood that can compare to this one? Let us know in the comments section!
