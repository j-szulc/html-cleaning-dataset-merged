Flowers add life to a room! Whether you choose a single blossom or a more complex arrangement, flowers add their own kind of architecture, character and color. If you love flowers as much as I do, click over to flower magazine, where in this month's issue, I weigh in on some of my favorite vessels and varieties for summer. 

In the print version (find yours here!), I even had the privilege of lending a few words to a rustic arrangement of billowy blue hydrangeas.

What flowers are you loving this summer?
