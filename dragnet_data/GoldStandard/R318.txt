two kisses for maddy (dua kecupan untuk maddy‏) is officially on the shelves in indonesia, which is pretty surreal (this copy comes courtesy of a friend of my friend, eshwari, who happens to live in jakarta).

the indonesian translation is published by serambi.

here’s the front cover:

(that photo was edited like crazy…i don’t have cheekbones like that).

and here’s an illustration from inside the book:

it even came with a bookmark!

according to google translation, the title reads:

two kisses for maddy

wait! that’s no fun…

here’s the full google translation of the publisher’s page, just in case you want to read it.

and the microsoft translator (which apparently serves mostly as a warning about using this translator) translates the title like this:

two peck for maddy

here’s the full microsoft translation of the publisher’s page.

so if you’re in indonesia, please go out and pick up the book. as i’ve done for past international versions of two kisses for maddy, the first person to send me a photo of him/her holding the book gets some sort of sweet prize. send your photo to me via twitter, instagram (i’m @mattlogelin both places) or via email: mattandmaddy (at) gmail (dot) com

also, i was recently featured on an episode of the inside acting podcast. no, i have not taken up acting, but i did discuss my life, my book, and of course, what’s it’s like to have my book optioned by lifetime. the interview was cut up into three parts.

part 1 is here.

part 2 is here.

(part 3 will be available next tuesday)

and in lifetime news, the contract is officially signed. what does the mean? i’m not really sure, but from what i understand, it simply means that the writers can get to work on the outline, which will then lead to the screenplay, which hopefully will be loved by lifetime, who will then start casting and filming. the very little i do know about the process is discussed in the podcast linked above, so give it a listen!

I love seeing the covers from other countries. It is so cool. I hope you have a copy from each of them. How many different languages has your book been published in now?

The cover photo is kind of cool and creepy all at the same time–you looks like Santa in The Polar Express.

More about life! Pretty please?? How’s Maddy? How are you? How’s Brooke? Any fun trips lately?

I am Indonesian and I’ve read your book. and I was very touched, then I look for news about you, from the internet or blogs. I am the mother of 2
a beautiful little girl. and I am so grateful to have them. I hope you can still live a more powerful along with madelline. and I believe Liz is very happy to see both of you do to remember her.

I love that the publisher’s page (at least translated) refers to baby Maddy as “the princess”! :)

Photoshop, it’s not just for super models anymore. At least Maddy is recognizable peeking over your (that is you, isn’t it?) shoulder.

And I agree with Skye, love the princess reference to Maddy!

I wonder if the publishers realized after printing that it’s, in fact, The New York Times.

Congrats on all your successes =)

I might have to use the Microsoft translator more often just for a good laugh every once in a while. LOL
SO happy for you Matt!

Asalamu Alaykom Mr. “Santa” Matt,

Tell me when it drops in Egypt and I’ll go take some pictures. Yes, I’m too cheap to buy a copy in Arabic. But I did buy it in English for my Kindle!

Did you ever read parts of the book to Maddy?
