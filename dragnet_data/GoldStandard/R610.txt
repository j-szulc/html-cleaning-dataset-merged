The AdWords Communities Global Summit 2012 took place on October 16-17th at Google’s Headquarters in Mountain View, California.  This event brought together over 50 of the most prolific contributors to the AdWords Communities from 20 countries. These experts deserve a heartfelt thanks for selflessly investing their time in providing guidance to other advertisers on the AdWords Communities forums. The Summit brought together Google’s Small and Medium Business (SMB) and support teams, product managers, as well as external speakers for two action-packed days covering the evolution of AdWords customer support in the digital age and the future of online Communities at Google.

Two of the sessions were also broadcast via Hangouts On Air.  In the first session, Deepak Khandelwal, Vice President of Global Customer Services and Sophie Bromberg, Director of Online Help, discussed the progress that AdWords customer support has made in the past year in helping to make Google a better company for Small-Medium Businesses (SMBs) to do business with. 

In the day's second session, a panel of members of Google's SMB team answered questions on the future of AdWords support and advertising. They discussed opportunities to use technology to make customer support more streamlined and customized, as well as emerging advertising opportunities in mobile, video, and social.

On the second day we honed in on the topic of online Communities. The program included workshops on content writing as well as breakout sessions for individual markets where Community members had the opportunity to help shape the future direction of the market-specific Communities.
