We've got another morning practice at Panthers training camp on tap for 10:30am. I want to give a big hat tip to those going the extra mile to give us tweets and other observations throughout TC. It has been a big help.

So let's keep it going...This is Now an Open Thread 





  #$%^&*()  COMMENTS





Let's do this. Got my PT reaction gifs loaded up in a separate tab.

I’m ready to handle any wild comment.

You have to format each line seperately, and figure out how long each line can be before it is cut off.

Again, why would you try to dunk it if you were that fat.

Can you not click on the title to collapse GIFs on phones?

I thought that was one reason we used titles for all images/gifs

by Philipkcks on Aug 9, 2012 12:34 PM EDT up    
I don't know if you can do it on phones...

But putting titles on all images/gifs is for people who have slow computers and/or are at work (and yes there are some companies that allow employees to read stuff at work but would frown upon seeing half-naked women or topcats in the rain on an employee’s computer).

but at this point last year we had already lost several players for the season. I really hope our LBs can manage a healthy season, and would love to see Norman and Hogan get back up to speed and compete

What seemed interesting was that

as NFL network was reporting the story, even the anchor was annoyed that this was a story he had to report. That was refreshing, even though Tebow was spoken about for at least 15 min of the show. Steve Smith had a 15 second part about his knee and Rivera hiding his pads. So there’s that too.
