An Interview With Thomas Hawk
Posted on October 30, 2012, 7:23 am, by Thomas Hawk

Photographer Mathew Hanley has an ambitious goal to interview as many Google+ photographers whose work he likes as possible. Iâ€™m his fourth interview. I love seeing people pursue projects like this where they promote photographers on the web. In the interview I talk about my neon signs project, my 100 largest American cities project, and other ideas around photography and the web.
