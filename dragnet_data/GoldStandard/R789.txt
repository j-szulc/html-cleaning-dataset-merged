Watch Anthony Bourdain's The Layover Season 2 Preview
Monday, November 12, 2012, by Matthew Kang 

Anthony Bourdain's second and final season with the Travel Channel's The Layover, which premieres November 19, starts with a forty-eight hour stroll through Chicago. Hot off the conclusion of nine seasons of No Reservations, Bourdain's looking to be more involved with what keeps him interested, like writing for Treme, comic books, The Taste, or even chocolate bars. The Layover was "a burden," with grueling two-day shoots and "more utilitarian" aspects, which one could chalk up to production limitations. In this two-minute sneak peek, Bourdain marvels at Stephanie Izard's West Loop restaurant, The Girl & The Goat, with its ten cooks and adventurous menu. Says Bourdain: "It's big. Bigger than I expected. But it works." Watch:
