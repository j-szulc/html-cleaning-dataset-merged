SEO Case Study: Income Protection Article
by Ben Hunt

If you read my recent SEO posts, you will quickly get a picture of the approach I promote:

    Create great content.
    Give it a push through classic PR techniques: reach out to relevant publications and websites through phone and email.

Here’s one example that we’ve just started working on for a UK financial services provider.

My team researched this article about income protection in the UK for several weeks. We even got a custom 3D graphic designed to illustrate it.

The amount of work that has gone into this article can be measured in weeks, not hours or days.

My theory is that, with proper promotion, a high-quality original piece like this can attract more (and better) links than you could get by investing the same amount of time in phoney link-building tactics (forum and blog comment spamming, etc.).

I will report back on the results!

This seems to be the new SEO way – write great content and then give it a gentle push. Do let us know how this particular example goes.

Thanks for sharing, Ben.

I feel better now about all the time I’m taking to work on my infographic. Just decided to hire an illustrator to get the image styles I really want.

I had a setback in the launch of my site BUT it’s giving me time to put some things in place so I can come out of the gate powered up and ready for sustained effort.

I’m also working on a 30-day eBook project. I’ll offer it to those who join and sign up for my email newsletter or whatever vehicle I decide to employ to get and keep people coming to the site.
