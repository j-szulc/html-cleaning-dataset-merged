Love this – Wallpaper!

Almost all the walls in my house will be white. But in my bedroom I want one wall with wallpaper. Lovely vintage style wallpaper. And maybe in the hallway to. And the spare bedroom.. Oh and maybe the craft room? That would be great to. But the problem is where do I begin? There are so many lovely vintage style and colorful wallpapers for sale. It’s hard to choose. Above you see a few of my favorites. But I might just wait until I have a little bit more money and then go for a weekend to Gent, Belgium. They have such a lovely wallpaper store there. With all kinds of vintage wallpapers. If you ever go to Gent you really have to visit it. It’s called Priem. XO Wilma
