New Delhi: Anna Hazare on Tuesday held a series of meetings with his supporters, including former Army Chief Gen VK Singh, to finetune the next course of action, and announced that he will soon form a national level trust to run his movement.

He also joined a protest, the first after his split with Arvind Kejriwal over the anti-corruption movement turning political, demanding release of Medha Patkar who is in detention in Madhya Pradesh.

"We will soon form a national level trust and announce its name. We are in the process of making a coordination committee which will have two representatives from each state. Working committee will also be formed soon," Hazare, who arrived in New Delhi on Monday, said. 

Hazare said his objective was not to pull crowds but to work at the grass root level. His day began with a lengthy meeting with the former Army Chief and later he visited a locality in north-east Delhi checking for an office for his movement in the capital.

At the protest in support outside Madhya Pradesh Bhavan, he alleged the detention of Patkar shows that democracy is being murdered. "Government is privatising public wealth. Whoever objects to it are harassed. Constitution is being bypassed. If Patkar is not released fast, we will launch an agitation," he said.

He also held meetings with volunteers at Maharashtra Sadan here. Activist Kiran Bedi was also present. Sources said Hazare was to inaugurate the Delhi office of the movement during this visit but the choice of building in UP's Kaushambi did not go well with him.
