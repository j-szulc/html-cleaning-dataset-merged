There is nothing more ridiculous than an anorexic distance runner doing a celebratory dance.

Kenyan 3000m steeplechase athlete, Ezekiel Kemboi, won gold in his event and immediately busted out some dance moves to die for. With Mick Jagger physically present for the race, Ezekiel literally showed he has ‘moves like Jagger’, much to the embarrassment of his native country.
