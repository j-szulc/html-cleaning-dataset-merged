Europe Dims German Outlook
Moody's Lowers Its View for Europe's Dominant Economy; Global Markets Slide

   BY CHARLES FORELLE AND DAVID ROMÁN

LONDON—The ratings firm Moody's Investors Service late Monday dimmed its outlook on Germany, the euro zone's dominant economic power and political force, further exposing the currency bloc's fragility on a day that also saw markets drop around the world on fears about Europe.

Moody's cited the huge potential cost of a euro breakup and, alternatively, the steep bill that would be paid to hold it together.

The warning to Germany followed a dramatic flight by investors from Spanish bonds Monday, leaving the euro zone's fourth-largest economy at grave risk of needing a bailout and sparking a selloff on global markets.
