Those of you who picked up a Mac on or after June 11 can soon pounce on a free upgrade to Mountain Lion.

Courtesy of Apple's OS X Mountain Lion Up-to-Date Program, consumers who bought a Mac from Apple or from an Apple authorized reseller between June 11 and the date when Mountain Lion debuts will have 30 days to request their free upgrade. The program allows qualifying buyers to download Mountain Lion for free directly from the Mac App Store.

As detailed by MacRumors, customers have to launch the Up-to-Date Program page, where an online form asks them to enter their contact information, date and location of purchase, and the serial number of the Mac. In return, they receive a redemption code via e-mail, which they can then submit at the Mac App Store to download the update.

The request form was initially live, allowing MacRumors to record the process, but has since been taken down in anticipation of the actual release of Mountain Lion. The new version of OS X is expected to launch this week, possibly as soon as tomorrow.

Apple owners running OS X Lion or Snow Leopard who don't qualify for the Up-to-Date Program can pick up Mountain Lion for $19.99.
