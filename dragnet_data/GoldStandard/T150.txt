3D Map Of Galaxies And Black Holes
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III has released a rather neat video of a flight through the universe that maps the various massive galaxies and black holes.

    With such a map, scientists can retrace the history of the Universe over the last six billion years. With that history, they can get better estimates for how much of the Universe is made up of dark matter - matter that we can't directly see because it doesn't emit or absorb light - and dark energy, the even more mysterious force that drives the accelerating expansion of the Universe. 

It's still neat to see one of these maps for whatever the reason.
