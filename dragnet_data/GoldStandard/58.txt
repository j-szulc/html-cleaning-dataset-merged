Officials Eyeing Possible Tsunami Debris off Wash.
WESTPORT, Wash. July 24, 2012 (AP)

Officials are monitoring a large piece of possible tsunami debris that appears to be a barge about 25 miles off Washington state's coast.

Grays Harbor County Emergency Management Deputy Director Chuck Wallace tells KBKW that the object looks to be about 25 feet by 16 feet and could've been torn away by the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.

Wallace says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been tracking the debris moving along the coast near Westport, Wash., for about a week. Officials don't when or where it might wash ashore.

Other pieces of tsunami debris that have hit North America's shores include boats, soccer balls and a shipping container holding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. In June, a 66-foot dock ripped loose by the big waves landed on Agate Beach near Newport, Ore.
