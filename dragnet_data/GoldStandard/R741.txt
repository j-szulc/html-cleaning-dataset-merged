Sara, I tested your turkey, too. It was fantastic, and got us through several days of no power.

Now my week is definitely made! Glad you had it to munch on during the storm. I hope all is well now.

There are a lot of great looking turkey photos out there, but yours has got to be the most beautiful one I've ever seen. Really!! ;o)
