In Shanghai this Week 

This week I'm in Shanghai and surrounding cities working on EHR implementation and health information exchange issues.

There will be a few days without blog posts this week due to my travels, but I will detail all the lessons learned when I return.

Aligning quality, safety, and efficiency with technology and politics pose the same challenges all over the world but the scale of China makes implementation particularly interesting.  

And now off to spread the gospel of Meaningful Use.
