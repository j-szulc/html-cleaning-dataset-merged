Roundup: Hurricane Gear

Beyond the Survival Kit

As Hurricane Sandy furiously barrels on like a scorned woman — and the East Coast grinds to a halt — we thought we’d leave you with a parting post today recapping some of our recent survival and outdoor gear. Keep in mind: this doesn’t include a basic survival kit, which we assume you already keep around the house stocked and ready to last several (if not more) days.

In case you need a recap on your most basic kit, here’s what we suggest for a 3-7 day self-sufficiency hoard: one gallon of water per person per day, non-perishable food, can opener, first-aid kit, toiletries, meds, phones and cables (don’t be the ass looking for a Lightning cable during a hurricane), flashlight, multitool and knife, solar charger, battery-powered radios, batteries, sleeping bags, blankets, a good book, game or iPad and plenty of cash.

But in case you’re the kind of guy who’s also interested in perusing some of the loftier gear out there (the power is still running after all), feel free to dive into some of our latest “hurricane” gear right this way. Until then, stay safe, hunker down with friends & family, learn about beef, and batten down the hatches.
