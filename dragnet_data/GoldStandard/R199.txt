Here’s J.J. Abrams (Lost, Super 8, Revolution) and one of my favorite question-askers/storytellers, Morgan Spurlock (A Day in the Life, Super Size Me) in a short video about choice, technology, and how to know which possibility to go after:

Isn’t this true with some of the Social Media choices we face? With so many choices – which do you go after? Certainly not all of them – that would turn into a slow process of none of them. Go after the one that thrills you first!  Hate Facebook but love Pinterest?  Go with Pinterest first.

When it comes to which Social Media track (or which “duck”) to go after first, what gives you the chills or thrills?

By the way, I’m lovin’ Zeitgeist Minds. Lots of great thinking going on.
