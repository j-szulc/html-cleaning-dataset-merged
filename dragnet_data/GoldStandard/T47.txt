We’ve been killing Johan this year, and I look for Malholm (despite bad numbers against Mets) to rebound and give another good starting performance tomorrow. I think we take at least 2 of 3, which we need to do because the schedule is about to get brutal after the Padres series.

With series against the Dodgers, Nats and Giants back to back to back, we need to win the series we are supposed to (which we’ve been doing), and go pound for pound against teams that are on the same level as we are. I believe those three series may define our season. WE need to beat the Nats in a series, this is of paramount importance. They have a tougher schedule coming up, too, but if we’re going to catch them, we’re the ones who have to do it.

Still, maybe we get lucky and the Astros finally get a game out of the Nats. They’ve pushed them in the three games, and I’m hoping they finally get one tonight.

Go Braves!
