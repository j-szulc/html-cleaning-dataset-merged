Are Brands People, Media or Publishers? Ad Age Misses the Point.

Like any professional industry, social media discussions can become unnecessarily “confrontational.”

The air quotes are to emphasize this confrontation isn’t heated by any means. It’s usually a keyboard-based back and forth that starts when someone makes a point and someone else splits hairs to create a counterpoint.

That’s what happened in the latest Ad Age Digital column, “No, Brands Aren’t People — and Consumers Don’t Want Them to Be.” The article, a response to “Why Brands Look Like People on Facebook,” goes to great lengths to draw a distinction between humans and brands.

For the rest of this article, visit Media is Power. MIP is a new content marketing platform I've been helping build at work . More to come on that test and learn project.

I agreed with your post. If we want to truly connect with consumers using social media, we need to do it on their terms, their turf and – as a result, considering how people serve up a brand through paid, earned and owned social media.

Swearing shouldn't be considered such a big deal. What is strange, to hear as a Jets fan, is the nonstop cockiness and bravado oozing out of Ryan and into his players, all for a team that did make the AFC championship game in January

One way that many people have been able to avoid personal bankruptcy is to consolidate debt. Often, people have accumulated many small debts that can be extremely difficult to pay at the same time. If you can consolidate these debts along with larger ones into one debt, it is much easier to avoid bankruptcy. jordan thunder 4,jordan 4 bred, http://www.jordanbred4.net

I agree that marketers and consumers need to understand a brand’s social media presence, but the company needs to understand the reasoning for needing a social media presence. I think a lot of companies and brands join social media, because the company feels that it has to. In order to be an effective brand companies need to: post at least once a day, and for Facebook, after 5 if possible; have one person “speaking” and promote one voice and listen and respond to its customers. If a brand knows the purpose for joining social media, consumers will understand it better too! Great post and check out my blog too at www.portsandlinesoftheair.wordpress.com

It was very opportune that I was able to find this post. My marketing class is discussing this. Hopefully I will be able to report this to my professor before Sandy knocks out my power. I just visited a local new jersey SEO company and found out just how successful a internet marketing campaign can be. Thanks for bettering my knowledge.
