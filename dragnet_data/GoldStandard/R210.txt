Yum!

    Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) — There is a teahouse near the Ullim Falls, a scenic spot in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

    The two-story teahouse is furnished with souvenir counter, open-air and indoor dining rooms, soft-drink stand and other facilities to serve tourists.

    … Ri Kyong Ae, a saleswoman, said: “Bread stuffed with vegetable or pear jam, boiled rice wrapped in leopard plant and dishes made of anise and aralia shoots are popular among visitors. They also like drinks made of barrenwort, corn floss and bellflower root, which are good for health.”

You might also know corn floss as corn “silk.” Bellflower root is a real food, though: It’s used in salads and as a traditional cold remedy. 

Those tourists, if they actually exist, are most likely Chinese. But you too can visit North Korea, which is working hard to attract Western tourism as a way to accumulate badly needed foreign currency reserves. I wrote earlier about the country’s bizarre tourist hotels, which have such fun nicknames as “hotel of doom” and “Alcatraz of fun.”
