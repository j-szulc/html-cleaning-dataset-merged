My Halloween costume for 2012: Matt Romney!

by Matt Cutts on October 31, 2012

in Fun

My fellow Americans, I’d like to introduce my latest Halloween costume: Matt Romney!

My five-point plan for the Mitt Romney Halloween costume went like this:

    Start with a suit and tie.
    Put a little silver in my sideburns. My wife used some silver and white eye shadow.
    Swoosh the hair up a little bit and lock it in with hairspray.
    Take off the glasses, and
    Add a flag. Boom!

This was a fun, easy, comfortable costume. I practiced a few of Mitt Romney’s catchphrases and I think people really enjoyed seeing “Matt Romney” around the Googleplex.

My wife and I are also trying something new for Halloween. I remember as a kid when I got a full-size candy bar for Halloween–it blew me away! I still remember those neighbors as really cool. Recently someone reminded me of that experience.

So this year, the first couple dozen kids who stop by our house are in for a nice treat:



Happy Halloween, everyone! You might also enjoy seeing some of my other Halloween costumes.

    You do realize that one of Mitt’s sons is, in fact, Matt Romney?

    I knew him in high school. Very, very nice kid- I liked him a lot. That said, I’m not voting for his father.

    Woah! The sans-glasses threw me through a loop! Great costume, Matt! My heart warmed a little bit at the full size candy bars thing. Fond memories there. This halloween, kids in my city are going to probably only get one thing: Frozen.

    That is a truly scary costume Matt and good on you for handing out those full-size candy bars.
Dan October 31, 2012 at 9:49 am

    This was funny because one of Mitt Romney’s sons is actually named Matt Romney. That’s who I thought you were at first.

    You always do the best Halloween costumes – the XKCD stickman is epic. Its also the only day each year I get a @mattcutts tweet :)

    Wow!

    I second AJ, that’s pretty out there – you’ll reel the kids in with the candy bars, for sure.

    Any magic undergarb?

    Doesn’t everyone hand out the full-size ones?!
Michael Dorausch October 31, 2012 at 10:05 am

    Wow, great job, and many will find it terrifying. Seeing all those treats gives me a November 30 day challenge idea. One piece of candy per day for 30 days. :D

    Happy Halloween!

    Hi,

    > My wife and I are also trying something new for Halloween.

    “Hey kids! I just did a Google search on ‘who hands out full size candy bars on Halloween’ and you’ll never guess what came up on Google Maps!!!”
Pete Young October 31, 2012 at 10:13 am

    Where do you live Matt – may send my kids round :)

    As a sidenote – like the haircut – maybe you should keep it :)
Gary Henderson October 31, 2012 at 10:23 am

    If you were Obama you could of avoided buying candy. You could of just taken from those who had large amounts of candy and redistributed the wealth to those less fortunate.
Todd Mintz October 31, 2012 at 10:25 am

    Great job (though it’s hard to top your Rick Astley costume).
Gerald Steffens October 31, 2012 at 10:33 am

    matt romney for president. you could make career in politics. after romneys electoral defeat you should become his successor. elaborated paraphrasing should be no challenge, you learned that at google extensively :-)
Ayan October 31, 2012 at 10:58 am

    Wow! This is one is scary, but i’m thinking to try little cuteness along with scary elements, might someone fall for me and I’ll get extra candy, I mean my little sister…
Max Minzer October 31, 2012 at 11:03 am

    Matt, I must admit – it took me 10+ seconds (after opening this in my Google Reader) to figure out who’s on the picture.
    You are truly in the character. Pretty scary…
Greg October 31, 2012 at 11:51 am

    I think you need to share a few zingers for your debate with the bing party’s barack oballmer.
Vince October 31, 2012 at 12:25 pm

    Is it really you Matt? Nice costume if yes… you look like a FBI Agent!
chris boggs October 31, 2012 at 12:33 pm

    ha nice costume! Our dentist happens to live on our street and he gives big candy bars to all his clients’ kids :)
Greg October 31, 2012 at 12:40 pm

    You forgot the blue jeans!
Greg Mattson October 31, 2012 at 12:58 pm

    And you have binders full of…?
Jay Berkowitz October 31, 2012 at 1:03 pm

    Awesome Matt, I love it, have fun tonight!
Scott Ensign October 31, 2012 at 1:06 pm

    Enjoy it while you can. Bloomberg will be banning full size candy bars soon.
Jim October 31, 2012 at 1:07 pm

    Hello Matt,
    I’am going to assume you have created many millions in dollar value for the Google over the last 12 years. Have they made you a millionaire yet?
Justin October 31, 2012 at 1:11 pm

    LOL I guess it’s easier for you to disguise yourself as Romney than as Obama :)

    BTW love your 30 day challenge idea – your TED talk inspired me to start doing them myself – started in March & still going!
Ross Dunn October 31, 2012 at 4:07 pm

    I love it Matt. To add a little extra try bushing up your eyebrows a bit and darkening them… Mitt has some bushy brows :-)

    Happy Halloween!
Bigdaddy October 31, 2012 at 6:00 pm

    I love the new look!!! Like the big candy bars even more ;-)
Rosendo Cuyasen November 1, 2012 at 3:18 am

    This is really nice. I really like it.. Thank you for showing this up in your blog.
Theo November 4, 2012 at 8:38 am

    LOL Love your sense of humor!
Rahul Mishra November 6, 2012 at 1:41 am

    Heyyy Matt….

    Really nice dress up.. 99% looking like Romney. Matt Romney is his son’s name. Anyway..you are looking pretty.. :)
Jay November 12, 2012 at 12:18 pm

    Isn’t that the same tie you wore for your Ask Jeeves costume? ;-)
