SPONSOR: Holiday Email Marketing Gifts from AWeber
posted on October 29, 2012 

Let’s try and take our minds off the weather for just a minute and think about something nice that is closer than we all imagine: the holiday season.

Christmas gift giving (and of course the buying needed to accomplish the giving) is becoming more and more prevalent in the minds of shoppers so it should be in the minds of marketers as well.

Our Email marketing sponsor, AWeber, has put together a great series called the 12 Days of Email Marketing. Over the next few Mondays we are going to give you all of the 12 fantastic email marketing helps that the email marketing specialists at AWeber have put together.

So without further ado here are days 1-3. Enjoy!

On the first day of email marketing, Aweber sent to me (don’t be afraid to sing this, it may brighten the mood a little or at least it will deeply disturb your co-workers)

A template for your email!

On the second day of email marketing, AWeber sent to me

An Email marketing checklist!

On the third day of email marketing, AWeber sent to me

A product marketing guide!

Each Monday for the next few weeks we will show you more that you can to get your email marketing just right for this holiday season.

Of course, you don’t have to wait that long either so you can go directly to the special AWeber holiday email marketing site to get all of your 12 free gifts immediately.

Happy Email Marketing!
