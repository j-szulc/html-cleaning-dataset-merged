If Michelle Obama Can Paint Her Nails for America, We Can Too

It's a little too late in the year for Fourth of July-inspired makeup looks or Memorial Day manicures, but today marks an important election year in the States. Props are a-plenty and the pros and cons need heavy thought all-around for these presidential candidates—and what better way to show your support than with a little help, Beautylish style? Even first lady Michelle Obama understands the power of beauty—her Democratic National Convention periwinkle manicure sparked the politic-polish sensation of the year! Maybe posters or a bumper sticker aren't your thing, but these examples prove no matter who you're voting for, a simple paint job can do wonders at the polls.
