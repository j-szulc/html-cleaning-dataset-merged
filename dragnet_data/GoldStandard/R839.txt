Wii U Launches At Nintendo World!

Well, the Wii U is coming out on November 18, and Nintendo has announced that the big Nintendo-sponsored launch event will be held at the Nintendo World Store in New York City! I'd thought it would be at the Times Square Toys'R'Us like the Wii all those years ago, but I guess they wanted to keep this one in the family.

Nintendo of America President and COO Reggie Fils-Aime will be on hand at the store as the clock strikes midnight on Saturday night and Sunday, November 18 begins with the sale of the very first Wii U console. (To Isaiah "Triforce" Johnson, I would imagine, since he's always the first in line for these sort of things... and I seem to recall hearing that he'd already gotten in line and had to go home because of Hurricane Sandy!)

The launch party starts at 6:00 pm, and goes until midnight, at which point everyone's just going to be buying their Wii U's and going home to play games. The party will continue at home, I suppose! There will be special treats for the people in line, although they're not saying what they are or how many of them they'll have.

What they will have for everyone to buy are New York-themed Mario T-shirts, the proceeds from which will be donated to the American Red Cross in support of Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. Which is pretty awesome, and I'm going to pick one up for myself for sure. Look for it in a future video podcast!

Hmm...I may actually be in town for this one? Even though I'm not buying a WiiU yet. It might be fun to check it out at least.
