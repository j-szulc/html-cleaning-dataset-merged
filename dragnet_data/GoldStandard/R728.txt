    Can’t take my eyes from this picture and even can’t realize which is the main reason, the beauty of the model or the garment.

    She looks fantastic! I love her style lately: sober, extremely elegant with powerful clean and bright colours. That white Jil Sander gown at the Vanity Fair party was simply espectacular!

    I love this look. Her style is so sophisticated. Is this dress new or vintage? It’s so difficult to find a great red dress.
