Almond Fall Wedding Cake

Here’s a fall wedding cake you could make at home. Its just a simple tiered cake covered with buttercream frosting and then decorated with rows of sliced almonds. We used sliced almonds without the skins to keep it more toward white and subtle but we also think it would be pretty to use the ones with the skins still on them for more texture and pattern. And then, just for fun, I made a little inspiration board from our Fall Weddings Pinterest board to give you a little more ideas of other weddings you could pair this fall wedding cake with…
