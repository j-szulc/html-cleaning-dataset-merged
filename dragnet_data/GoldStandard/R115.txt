Halloween family costumes are so much fun! I went through my photos and collected some of our family costumes from the Halloween past. Enjoy these easy homemade costumes plus a few more creative family costume ideas!

One of the funniest DIY family costumes I made, was when we were cops and robbers.

One of our latest family Halloween costumes, the Diary of a Wimpy Kid family! If you don’t know about these books, click here (they are great!).

I was Captain Hook when I had brown hair years ago for our Peter Pan Family Costume. Arggggg!

Jill from Kitchen with My 3 Sons makes the most adorable family costumes for her kids! This camping theme is amazing! That is a replica of their actual camper.

I also LOVE this original Pirate themed costume that Jill created. The treasure chest is hilarious!

Julie-Anne’s family of farmers found via Costume Works is so cute! Love the chickens:-)

This family of Legos made from cardboard boxes is fun!

Min‘s Scooby Gang is super cute.

Popeye and Olive Oyl and Sweet Pea make a fun and easy family costume idea!

Here is another fabulous Pirate themed costume that came complete with a homemade parrot!
