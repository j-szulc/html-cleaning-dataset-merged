David Allen on GTD for Startup Founders



Just posted the interview that Patrick and I did with David Allen, founder of GTD. You’ll find it at startupsuccesspodcast.com.

Speaking of things GTD, I’m now switching back to Things from OmniFocus. I just found myself too distracted by OmniFocus and its intricacies and not focusing on the actual things I want to get done. Now that Things has become Things2 and added cloud synchronization, I’m giving it another try, going with a lightweight approach, and will see how that works out. You might want to do the same.
