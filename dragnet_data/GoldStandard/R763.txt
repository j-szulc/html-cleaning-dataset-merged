Back in July I made a couple of iPhone wallpapers which seemed to be quite popular, ever since then I’ve been meaning to do a full range of wallpapers and I’ve finally got round to it. To download, click the thumbnail of the corresponding wallpaper you want, then right+click or ctrl+click and save.

iPhone

Blackberry

iPad (1024×768)

1280×800

1600×1200

While I’m here I shoud probably explain my absence. I’ve been slightly busy but to be honest with you I just haven’t really known what to say! I’ll be back soon, but for now enjoy these wallpapers. Shout out to @22eduardo9 on twitter who’s been nudging me since July for these!

See ya.

    Really? Get over it. New badge sucks compared to the old one but which way the cannon points… not that fussed.

    hey these are awesome BUT the cannon wheel outlined in white and the cannon not outlined in white makes the wheel the focal point of the image, could you do it with a white outline on the cannon too?
