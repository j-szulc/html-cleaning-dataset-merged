Mobile social networking is continuing to grow at a fast pace in the US. By 2014, nearly half of the US mobile population will use mobile social networking, according to recent eMarketer estimates. And while the rate of growth is slowing – down to 40% this year, from 50% last year – it will stay in the double digits through 2014 (with 18%).

The end of 2012 wil see more than a quarter of the US population using mobile social networking on their mobile at least monthly, or 82 million US mobile users – and 95% of those users will be accessing social via smartphone.

How many of these mobile social network users are accessing Facebook? According to eMarketer, 85% of the mobile social networking population (or 70 million people) are accessing Facebook via mobile.  That percentage will slowly climb to 87% by 2014, when almost two-thirds of smartphone users – and nearly 1 in 4 mobile users – will use mobile to check Facebook.
