Make a pretty fall tree that is beautiful window art as well. Using tissue paper and construction paper, this pretty tree craft is perfect for even the littlest hands. This is a great art and craft project to do while talking about fall, trees, colors and even texture.

Supplies for Tissue Paper Fall Trees:

    Brown construction paper
    Red, orange, purple, brown and white tissue paper
    Scissors
    Glue

1. Cut a tree shape from a piece of brown construction paper: Fold a piece of brown construction paper in half. Cut out a half circle to make the top of the tree and a rectangle for the tree trunk. Tip: folding the paper in half can make it easier to create an even tree shape.

2. On the back of the tree, add white and brown tissue paper: Glue a piece of brown tissue paper on the trunk area, make sure to overlap the edge of the cutout tree shape. Glue a piece of white tissue paper cover the leafy area of the tree. Now you’re ready to add some color! Turn your tree paper over so you are working on the front side of the tree. Using the red, purple and orange tissue paper, cut out circles about 1-2” in diameter. Glue the circles in the leaf area of the tree.

You can make any kind of pattern you’d like. Overlap the circles for a pretty leaf look.

3. Once the glue dries, you can hang your tree art in a window and the light will shine through the tissue paper.

Tip: Change the colors you use to create different looks.
