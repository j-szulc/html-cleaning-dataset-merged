These pics look good.
I will be curious to see a comparison with the 70-200 f/2.8.

Looks good want to see comparisons with the 2.8

Took a look at the larger versions on Flickr. Definitely seems like a tack sharp lens.

Any sharpness comparison with the f/2.8 is going to be splitting hairs. They’re both going to be ridiculously sharp in the hands of a competent photographer.

What really sells me on the f/4 is weight, price and VRIII.

    Any Nikon link to see the explanation and differences of the VR1, 2, 3?
    If we ask Nikon support they just say “It is better” :-(

        Basically each VR just means improvements by 1 stop, if I’m not mistaken VR3 is 5 stops?

            Yes, VRIII is 5 f/stop, you might be right, thank you!
            Look forward for VRVIII then :-)

This lens is 1/2 the weight of the 2.8, perhaps for that reason has no tripod collar, 67mm filters, one glass less inside and … $1,000 less!

It might show more vignetting at f/4 compared to the 2.8 at f/4.
Guess Nikon made it in the spirit of the D600, right?

    They (finally!!) made it in the spirit of the Canon 70-200 f/4 L IS, which came out six years ago. This lens has been arguably the most glaring remaining hole in Nikon’s lens lineup, and had it existed a few years back I might well have bought a D700 instead of a 5D2, especially since the Nikon tax compared to the analogous Canon is only ~$200. The *real* comparison to see is between these two f/4 lenses, not against Nikon’s own f/2.8.

    A postbellum 135mm f/2 design is the next gaping hole in my view of Nikon’s lineup, though the rumor mill last year said that we’d never get one.

    Agreed. This is certainly not a close-up lens.

    Seems to me that this shot was probably included to illustrate how well the background can be made to melt away with a lens that ‘only’ opens to F4, and in that regard it illustrates the point very effectively. This will be one of the issues which will help buyers choose between this and the F2.8 lens.

    Damn right! Those I’d buy ASAP, whereas the 70-200 f4 is all like, ‘Oi! This looks nice, but my pockets a bit light and me mum is ill… ya know.’

    I’d rather have the 135mm f/2 DC with VR. Maybe a 400mm non f/5.6 as well @ $1,500
    
        EnPassant
        Posted October 29, 2012 at 8:46 am  

        $ 1500 is just enough to buy both a used, current 135/2 DC and the old, manual Nikkor 400/5.6 Ai-S.

    +1 for the 135mm 1.8G but I’m still trying to think about how much that lens would cost. If it came out for under $2000 I’d be interested but if it has VR in it which it more than likely will it will probably be over $2000 easily. If it’s at the right price I would trade in my 70-200mm VR to put towards the 135mm.

    Wow – those shots on Fred Miranda’s site are fabulous.

    I’ve been waiting for a lens like this from Nikon for a long time. Definitely moves to #1 on my wishlist.

Aside from the 1-stop low-light advantage of the 2.8G, it has very little over the 4G. Even for bokeh: the blur diameter of any point of the background is only %44 larger on the f/2.8 than on the f/4. And I’m guessing the bokeh will be less nervous on the f/4.

Pre-order complete!

i’ll be a little bit sellfish, but as i own a 2.8VRII i hope the F4 sucks! ^^


    person who thinks
    Posted October 29, 2012 at 4:08 am  

    so sell it, buy the f/4 and come out $500 ahead. If I were you I would hope it is REALLY GOOD

        I think if a photographer had the option of selecting “as a gift” between the f/2.8 Vs f/4 I am pretty sure he/she would select the 2.8.
        But for us “regulars”, the f/4 is mighty sufficient and the f/2.8 is not needed (sour grapes case)

Had a chance to try one of the first pre-production copies of this lens. Was pretty impressed. Was shooting down to 1/5th of a second hand held and viewing at & beyond 100% with the D800 and the VR was extremely impressive.

It’s a great weight and feels just as solid as it’s big brother. This lens is going to do great in the market.

Unfortunately I wasn’t allowed to take photos of it or put a card in the camera.

Was told they will be shipping late November, in Canada at least.

        His question is legitimate – there are FX lenses that don’t work so well on DX bodies – because of the body design (not the mount or the sensor themselves).
        The PC-E Nikkors come to mind.
        I don’t expect any problems with this lens, though, and it should balance better on the D7000 than the F2.8 tele.

I own a 70-200 2.8 VR I and have the f/4 on order. I would prefer to lose a stop in favour of a smaller/lighter lens I’m more likely to bring with me, and corner-corner sharpness on FX. Looks like I will just about break even on resale of my 4-year-old 2.8 too.

Hmm.. I’m just waiting for a drop in the price. Its a pity Nikon prices don’t drop as low as Canon’s.. and so i feel that Canon fans have all the fan.

5D mk ii goes for $1699 and 5D mk iii for $2994 all @ B&H (Offer ends 24th Nov).. Sigh!
The Nikon D300s that err.. no one really buys is still $1,699????

smh, well..

    Well considering canons BEST sensor is 12th on the list, behind nikons cheapo entry level cameras, who cares? Canons cameras need to be cheaper!

Tamron 70-200/2.8 VC is much better and cheaper. Who cares about weight?


    Apollo
    Posted October 29, 2012 at 9:19 am  

    Tamron is horrible. So soft @ f2.8 and even f4! And it’s very cheap feeling, it won’t last for long. Slow focus, poor stabilization! I don’t recommend Tamron, I rather recommend Sigma or more, used 70-200mm VR1.

I regularly take these kind of photos with my kit 18-200 lens.
I thought they will show better snaps for a £1000 lens.

Looks some good samples – why couldn’t they put some at full res (16 – 24mp) and to cobby64 Nikon lens prices aren’t bad as Canon’s yet – over £2k for a 24-70 L Usm 2.8 lens thats a lot of money compared against Nikon’s equivalent for £1200.

It seems from early reviews that the VR is extremely impressive to match top-notch image quality. I’m buying one in all likelihood once comprehensive testing has confirmed the initial impressions.
But, what I dream of, is a 300f4 with this new VR. Wow, that would be some lens. :)

Not to burst anyones bubble, but how does this compare to the existing 70-300 VR?
Less than a stop difference at 200mm for half the price and less weight still.

Why would you buy the 70-200 f/4? (I mean: please help me justify ordering this lens!)
IQ, weathersealing…..? anything else?


    camguy
    Posted October 29, 2012 at 8:34 am  

    build quality, sharper, no variable aperture, weather sealing, no moving barrel, take your pick.. Lots of reason. The 70-300 is miserable at 200-300 and i don’t think so good from about 135 to 200. 70-135 is very sharp though. Variable aperture also constantly has you adjusting exposure (assuming your shoot manually) every time you change zooming any noticeable amount. Also keep in mind that with variable aperture, yes the aperture changes in steps in the camera. but physically it changes in a fluid amount. So even though from 70-135 or whereever, the camera says 4.5 throughout, but you slowly go 4.5 , 4.6, 4.7.. until you hit the next level where the camera shifts to f4.8, 5.3 etc… The camera just estimates to keep with standard aperture numbering. so the variable aperture lenses change exposures very slightly as you zoom even though the camera doesn’t say that and model cameras may even compensate for it. this is pretty much an irrelevant/unnoticeable thing and i wouldn’t worry about it at all, but it’s there. the fixed aperture zooms are designed so this doesn’t happen, so they are much more complex, hence the higher price/size/weight/quality. Generally because they are more complex, the higher quality construction and better glass follows naturally driving the price up further. You just end up with all around better images from them

    you do not need any justification to change a (relatively) low IQ, variable maximum relative aperture with a super IQ ans fixed aperture zoom

I am very interested in the results of this lens wide open at 200mm with a 20TC III attached. I would like to see how the sharpness and IQ compares to a similar images taken with the 70-200 f2.8 either VR I or VRII both wide open at f5.6 and then at f8. Bottom line, I would like to know how useable shots taken with the TC would be wide open, since I would not want to shoot the newest version at f11. I am interested pro level zoom lens in a smaller package, but I would not trade in my f2.8 copy.

Posted October 29, 2012 at 1:24 pm  

Pardon my ignorance. What is the typical use of this? I understand light weight but isn’t this little shorter at 200mm when compared to other 300mm lens and also this f4 rather than 2.8.

Usually people go for faster aperture but here its the other way around.

Given a normal light outside how much of a difference it is 70-200mm f4 and say 70-300 3.5-5.6 lens?

Just checking. Thanks for your responses.
