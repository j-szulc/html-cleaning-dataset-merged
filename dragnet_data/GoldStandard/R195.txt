Apple’s cloud-based messaging application, iMessage, experienced a few hours of service issues, the company confirmed on its iCloud support site Tuesday afternoon.

At 2:15 p.m. Pacific, Apple updated a support site to confirm what disgruntled Twitter users and Apple forum posters had suspected for roughly an hour prior: iMessage is not functioning properly.

The downtime is said to affect “some” users, though Twitter and forum updates suggest that the outage is affecting people in different regions all across the world.

Update: At 3:54 p.m. Pacific, Apple updated its support site and said that iMessage and all iCloud services were working again. The company also confirmed earlier Game Center service issues that affected all users, and FaceTime problems for some.

Tuesday’s service interruption is yet another unpleasant hiccup for the Cupertino company’s iCloud offerings. iMessage may also not be only victim today, as some folks are also complaining about issues with Game Center and iTunes Match.

Game Center, Apple’s cloud-based game hub for iOS users, experienced its own meltdown at various times late last week and through the weekend, upsetting players of the hot game Letterpress.

Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.
