YouTube: Rikki Don't Lose That Number Solo

By Dan Cross, About.com GuideOctober 30, 2012

Steely Dan fans will want to take a look at this instructional video which walks viewers through playing the solo to "Rikki Don't Lose That Number" on acoustic guitar. Rick Ruskin, the instructor in the video, initially plays the whole solo, then breaks it down piece by piece. Even though Ruskin moves slowly, this is nonetheless a challenging piece of music to play... intended for intermediate and advanced guitarists.

    Wow that definitely inspired me to work on this! Thanks for posting it for us Dan.
    Doing some (a lot!) of searching the net, I found some tab, with the solo included, here:

    I’m not sure if the tab has everything there for the solo but it’s something to start with, and study along with the video. Thanks again,
    Mike
