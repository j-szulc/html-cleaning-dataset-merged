We’re on Pinterest!

At long last, we are here to support your pinning addiction! (and maaaaybe we’ve gotten a little addicted ourselves in the process….it really is a vortex of amazingness.) Its also possible that we’ve been working on a lot of other big (big) new things that we were going to wait and share all at once but…..we’ve decided the Once Wed Pinterest page is ready enough to share with you now!

We’ve been building up all kinds of wedding related boards (and even some not so wedding related boards because maybe we can’t help ourselves!) over the last couple of weeks and we will continue to pin pin pin away. It really is such a helpful way to plan a wedding, right?? Also, please let us know if there are any other specific boards you’d like to see on our page! CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW US ON PINTEREST!
