Harry Fraud – “Mean” (Feat. French Montana & Action Bronson)

Harry Fraud, the spaced-out New York rap producer, has been going absolutely nuts this year, scoring actual hits and cranking out copious amounts of hazy underground boom-bap at the same damn time. And now he’s accepted Scion money to release “Mean,” his first song under his own name, roping in two of his most frequent collaborators in the process. French Montana and Action Bronson are two guys who know exactly how to rap over Harry Fraud beats, and they sound great here. Use the widget below to download the song.
