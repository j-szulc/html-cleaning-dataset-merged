Toronto Blue Jays at Tampa Bay Rays, Aug 9, 2012 1:10 PM EDT

This may be wrong -- I can't check right now -- but according to Baseball Press, Ben Zobrist is starting at short today.

Blue Jays	Rays
1. Rajai Davis (R) LF 	1. Sam Fuld (L) LF
2. Colby Rasmus (L) CF 	2. B.J. Upton (R) CF
3. Edwin Encarnacion (R) 1B 	3. Matt Joyce (L) RF
4. Yunel Escobar (R) SS 	4. Evan Longoria (R) DH
5. David Cooper (L) DH 	5. Ben Zobrist (S) SS
6. Moises Sierra (R) RF 	6. Carlos Pena (L) 1B
7. Jeff Mathis (R) C 	7. Jeff Keppinger (R) 3B
8. Omar Vizquel (S) 2B 	8. Ryan Roberts (R) 2B
9. Adeiny Hechavarria (R) 3B 	9. Jose Lobaton (S) C

I guess the Rays are getting desperate in their attempt to bump   Zobrist's trade value. /guffaw

how about Alvarez?

"Besides his clutch double play, Longoria also struck out three times. Good to have you back, Evan."
I know he’s not 100%, and he’s still getting his timing back…but honestly, if he’s like this (for the time being, at least) how is he helping? Is the THREAT of his bat helpful? I haven’t researched pitch types or locations of the hitters before him. If it is, and maybe changes the way pitchers pitch to the batter before, then good. But if it appears that nothing is changing and he’s doing nothing but hitting grounders that he is not going to beat out or K, why is he in the lineup?

Zobrist at short

Is that to open   this scenario

Pena 1B
Kepp 2b
Zobrist SS
Longo 3b when healthy
Scott Dh when healthy

Probably would be for the best offensively and then put in Srod and ej in the 7th or 8th when we are ahead. Let the pen finish it off

by gatrmf on Aug 9, 2012 1:44 PM EDT via mobile

but i’m not sure longo plays 3b at all for the rest of the season

yeah, even bringing Molina back for cheap would be fine with me

as long as he is where he belongs in the back   spot. I’m just wondering if Lobs can hold down a semi full time gig over a full season.

"Besides his clutch double play, Longoria also struck out three times. Good to have you back, Evan."
I know he’s not 100%, and he’s still getting his timing back…but honestly, if he’s like this (for the time being, at least) how is he helping? Is the THREAT of his bat helpful? I haven’t researched pitch types or locations of the hitters before him. If it is, and maybe changes the way pitchers pitch to the batter before, then good. But if it appears that nothing is changing and he’s doing nothing but hitting grounders that he is not going to beat out or K, why is he in the lineup?

Capitalism...I started shooting   coins when i was 15. Within six months i was puttin bills in my arm daily. Sometimes, if i was really hard  , id do a whole checkbook to my head. Before i knew it i was jerkin off accountants for a taste of their bank ledgers. Well, all those careless jack seshs eventually lead to me contracting capitalism. At first...i just thought i was rich, but then i noticed i was greedy and powerful. The doctors are doing everything they can to help, but they're just as addicted to money as i am. Now im forced to live out my days womanizing my trophy wife and playing golf. Please...dont try money...not once...not ever...

Happy birthday to Dickie.

I know he’s not 100%, and he’s still getting his timing back…but honestly, if he’s like this (for the time being, at least) how is he helping? Is the THREAT of his bat helpful? I haven’t researched pitch types or locations of the hitters before him. If it is, and maybe changes the way pitchers pitch to the batter before, then good. But if it appears that nothing is changing and he’s doing nothing but hitting grounders that he is not going to beat out or K, why is he in the lineup?

Rays Prodigious Lefties through first 22 Starts

Pitcher ERA TBF niBB% SO% FIP
Moore 3.69 557 11% 23% 3.95
Kazmir 4.97 520 14% 20% 4.46
Price 4.29 533 10% 18% 4.69

For all the people that have a problem with what Matt’s done, he’s probably ahead of what you should expect

Kazmir is out of the league and Price should be a closer.

Does this include the playoff start?

Also, I can’t believe the amount of bitching and backtracking people are making about Moore. He’s been fine.

Capitalism...I started shooting   coins when i was 15. Within six months i was puttin bills in my arm daily. Sometimes, if i was really hard  , id do a whole checkbook to my head. Before i knew it i was jerkin off accountants for a taste of their bank ledgers. Well, all those careless jack seshs eventually lead to me contracting capitalism. At first...i just thought i was rich, but then i noticed i was greedy and powerful. The doctors are doing everything they can to help, but they're just as addicted to money as i am. Now im forced to live out my days womanizing my trophy wife and playing golf. Please...dont try money...not once...not ever...
