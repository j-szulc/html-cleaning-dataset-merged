Samsung Nexus 10 Tablet

The fight is finally on


The Nexus 7 was a beachhead for the Nexus brand in the tablet market and took direct aim at Amazon’s Kindle Fire. The newly unveiled Nexus 10 ($400) now hopes to succeed where other larger Android tablets have failed in finally creating a legitimate Android competitor to Apple’s iPad dynasty. Screens have been the primary battle ground to date in the space and in that department this Samsung-made hardware is no slouch, featuring a 10.5-inch screen packs with retina-rivaling 2,560 x 1,600 display. All of those pixels are pushed by a beefy dual-core, 1.7 GHz Samsung Exynos CPU as well as a Mali T604 GPU, while 2GB of ram, a 9,000mAh, stereo speakers, NFC, microUSB and microHDMI ports, and a 5MP rear and 1.9MP front-facing camera round out the rest of the notable features.

Size-wise, the Nexus 10 measures 8.9mm thick and weighs 603 grams, slightly besting the iPad 4 in both categories. Unfortunately, only wi-fi only models will be available starting November 13th directly from Google’s Play store in the US, UK, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Canada and Japan.
