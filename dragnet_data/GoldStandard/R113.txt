Papa Says
October 25, 2012

We can’t have a series about motherly life lessons without acknowledging some solid Dad-isms.   This Dad of mine has a lot of gems to teach.  To be fair, I was a little girl with curly bangs and a mild mullet… I needed a lot of guidance.  Mom is the guide to ‘act right, eat your apple, and don’t steal my scissors’.  Dad is the guide to ‘act right, watch this movie, and save me the last biscuit’.  All very important lessons.

I love the people who raised me.  Beyond!

Papa Says (or heavily implies):

I’m going to work literally aaallll night long because I love you and you require food and electricity.  When I get home at 5am, I’m going to wake you up so we can make a pie together.  You’ll moan and groan about it, but you’ll thank me later.

I know you’re six years old, and you can’t possibly understand the nuance and beauty of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, but we’re going to watch it over and over and over again.  One day it will blow your mind.

Whole Wheat Fig Newton Cookies are dessert.  (I still disagree with this notion, Father.)

Conversely, Carrot Cake is pretty much a vegetable.

Did someone say waffles?  Let’s definitely make waffles.

If there is an ant in the kitchen, it’s a family emergency.  Everyone UP!  Out of bed!  We’re getting to the bottom of this.

How many times do I have to tell you to rinse your dishes, to wrap up the bread, the clean up the cereal, to take out the trash, to clean up your room. How many times do I have to tell you?  (Answer, Dad:  you’ll have to tell me a lot of times… like A LOT.)

Don’t mess around with boys that disrespect you.  I didn’t teach you to put up with that nonsense.

If you’re going to bring a boy home… well, he best address me as Mr. Wilson (and you really shouldn’t bring very many boys home).

You do not give the expensive canned tuna to stray cats.  That is something you do.not.do.

Eat your vegetables.  Your mother and I bought them for you and you will, you really will eat them.

I’m not going to raise my voice very often, but when I do, it will shake you to your core.

Your mother and I are on the same team and you won’t be able to get one over on us with your child-brain trickery.  Did you Mom say no?  I say no too.  One exception:  I will buy you that Gap sweater even though it’s not on sale.

It’s midnight.  Let’s get doughnuts.

Whatever you don’t eat off your dinner plate, I will eat.  Most specifically, if you want to save me a few bites of your chicken and biscuits… I think that would be great.

Pie is not pie unless it’s warm.

Life’s a beach, as illustrated by my fashion.

Trade dads?

    That’s what I was thinking.
    

Lorna October 25, 2012 at 12:28 pm

awww, such a GORGEOUS and ‘he he’ read!
My first post from you and looking forward to receiving more deliciousness.

nancy October 25, 2012 at 12:37 pm

I’m sure your Dad is very proud of the person you’ve become. Both your parents sound like they have “their heads screwed on straight”. That’s something my parents used to say!

Stefanie October 25, 2012 at 12:43 pm

Heart, soul, butter and sugar… I love your blog and appreciate all you put into it. This post is especially heartfelt and helps explain how you got to be the down to earth, fun, inspiring baker, blogger you are today! As always, you’ve left me already looking forward to your next post.

Debra October 25, 2012 at 12:44 pm

Joy: can your Dad adopt me? Lovely blog today. Thanks

Carolina October 25, 2012 at 12:48 pm

so nice what you’ve written…!

Kathleen @ksugarandspice October 25, 2012 at 1:00 pm

You made me love MY dad a little bit more, didn’t think that was even possible. Now pass me the biscuits and gravy.

Beth October 25, 2012 at 1:28 pm

Love this, Joy. Thanks for sharing. Dads are awesome and wonderful :)

Joanne P October 25, 2012 at 1:47 pm

omg i love this. reminds me of my daughter and her dad. so sweet.

Julie October 25, 2012 at 2:05 pm

i love these posts. so often i can still hear my mother’s words of wisdom in my own head., whether i’m looking for them or not! :) i’m sure that makes parents proud.

stepha October 25, 2012 at 2:16 pm

Such a cute post! Gotta love dads :)

Lis October 25, 2012 at 2:19 pm

Love this, thank you. My daddy died two years ago; your words are a springboard to restate some of his life lessons. Such gifts.


    joythebaker October 25, 2012 at 2:27 pm

    this really warms my heart. thank you for commenting!
    

Angela October 25, 2012 at 2:24 pm

Daddies are the best! They really do factor into the amount of nonsense you will not tolerate; and your diet (You’ll bones will break if you don’t eat peas with that pizza. Pizza and burgers are not reall food. But, yes, cake before breakfast is okay.). and everything else.

Mandy October 25, 2012 at 2:48 pm

But, but…don’t the stray cats deserve the expensive tuna?! So cute!

Mama Maria October 25, 2012 at 4:15 pm

Oh Joy, you were the cutest little girl ever! No wonder your dad couldn’t say no to the GAP sweater. :) I also now see were you get your wit. Dads are so important. I love my pop and I still look to him for approval and guidance, and I’m 47!!! Ha ha, couldn’t be the person I am today without him.

Jessie October 25, 2012 at 4:23 pm

Sweet sweet post Joy! Dad’s and Mom’s are truely great to have!! Thanks for sharing!

Laura Ann T. October 25, 2012 at 4:28 pm

So sweet and funny. What a wonderful man you have for a father.

celeste October 25, 2012 at 4:47 pm

everything about pie at 5am brings me to tears and a great appreciation for my dad and yours and dads around the world who do crap like this. mostly i’m super grateful for a husband who is that kind of dad.

clemence October 25, 2012 at 4:47 pm

Oh, Joy- this post warmed my heart ;-)

Bakerkat October 25, 2012 at 4:49 pm

Sounds like you Dad is pretty wonderful. Your lucky

Cairine Stade October 25, 2012 at 4:52 pm

Love your Dad’s rules, the love shines through them! You sure look like your Dad!

Jennifer Duncan October 25, 2012 at 5:06 pm

Do you have ANY idea how lucky you are?

*sigh*

Ana F October 25, 2012 at 5:32 pm

Very touching, you are lucky to have a great dad. Love the picture and you were the cutest, no wonder dad couldn’t say no….

kiki October 25, 2012 at 5:44 pm

I love this post! I feel like my dad taught me a lot of the same life lessons/advice. Maybe it’s dad-of-daughters-thing? Although, my dad taught me that pie is not pie unless it’s cold. And I have to say, that’s the only way I like my pie to this day. :)

Cate October 25, 2012 at 6:27 pm

Love this SO much. You really have awesome parents.

irma October 25, 2012 at 8:11 pm

That was one of the sweetest stories ive ever red.Tomorrow I’m celebrating my Dad’s 86th birthday, I’m so fortunate to still have him around, u sound pretty lucky too.He sounds like a wonderful Dad.

Bianca @ Confessions of a Chocoholic October 25, 2012 at 9:02 pm

That picture is adorable!! Very cute post.

Dawn "vintage vixen arts" October 25, 2012 at 9:24 pm

Adorable!! The picture, the post.. I’m hooked, and I just found you via the fun luncheon with Cupcakes and Cashmere. It’s time for me to get into my fall comfort food mode, and I’m happy to find a new excellent cook to visit! Cheer’s!

anna October 25, 2012 at 9:39 pm

suuuuper super sweet. what a great picture. i grew up without a dad, but i’m sharing this with my husband and his dad because they will appreciate it.

Amy October 25, 2012 at 10:47 pm

Beautifully written as always.
A girl’s Daddy always holds a special place in her heart, and I am so grateful that I have (in my opinion) one of the best in the world. My Dad always told me: ‘You are a Chatwin, be proud of it. Don’t take crap from anyone’, and ‘The answer to any, repeat ANY of life’s questions, whether they be about how to serve dessert, or how to get over a broken heart, is always cream AND ice cream, always.’

Tori (@eatori) October 26, 2012 at 1:32 am

Could your parents be any cooler? Best lesson from my Dad; use excel. Really, learn it. Love it. I mocked him for years.But you know what? It’s really pretty helpful. Oh- and you don’t need a celebration for champagne. A bottle makes a celebration out of everyday.

Paulette October 26, 2012 at 3:45 am

That is a great picture of you and your dad. Love the article and it brings back wonderfu memories of my father who passed in 2001. My dad was always teaching his four girls (yes four girl) the lessons of life in everythin he would do with us. We drove him crazy and he smiled from ear to ear when walking each one of us down the isle. But he knew that even marriage would never keep us from always being with him and mom. I always thought he missed having a son but one day he told me while we were taking care of him in his illness and I asked him if he did. Dad replied ” It would have been nice but I never woud have changed a thing knowing what I know how on just how special a relationship is between a father and his daughter” Thanks Joy

Debbie D. October 26, 2012 at 4:37 am

I am so in love with your Dad! What an incredible man.

Kristin October 26, 2012 at 5:17 am

Lovely! Makes me really wish my dad was this kind of dad. I’m happy you had this experience!

Debbie Fechter October 26, 2012 at 5:53 am

When i read this I smiled so wide I thought my face might crack! I am almost 43 years old and I still call my dad EVERY morning at 9 am just to “check in”. My mother always says “you are your father’s daughter” and I am proud of that. Yeah sometimes he can be hard headed and mulish but he’s MY dad and I love him! Cheers to you for a thoughtful blog entry!

MrsNumbles October 26, 2012 at 6:57 am

This made my ENTIRE.FRIDAY. I’m not sure why, but maybe it’s because I’m at the front desk of the UK university library that I work for, and slighly missing home(VA). But it make me snicker, made me giggle, made me slightly weepy…..and determined to bake myself silly this weekend.

Been enjoying your blog since you started – don’t ever change! ;o)

Carly October 26, 2012 at 8:00 am

I don’t know what I love more – your dad’s rule or that amazing photo of him!

I hope my kids feel this way about their dad/my husband when they’re adults. Because he’s pretty awesome.


    Carly October 26, 2012 at 8:10 am

    I also love all of the comments that have come from this post. You really are an inspiration to so many people, Joy.
    

Vicki B October 26, 2012 at 8:19 am

So cute! Dad’s like your’s are very very rare.

Synne October 26, 2012 at 8:42 am

Now THIS is wisdom. I absolutely love 2001: ASpace Odyssey. And waffles. And everything you share, Joy. Thanks.

Rebecca October 26, 2012 at 9:53 am

Joy, this is so sweet! I lost my dad recently, and I can tell you that those little things like giving your dad the last biscuit is super important. I wish I could give my dad all the biscuits.

jenny October 26, 2012 at 9:55 am

how can someone be so awesome?

love your blog!

Michelle G October 26, 2012 at 10:34 am

Aw, what a sweet post. Thank goodness for wonderful dads like yours.

Rocky Mountain Woman October 26, 2012 at 10:59 am

Yikes! Your dad is a VERY HANDSOME man….

xxoo,

RMW

Axelle the french cook October 26, 2012 at 11:25 am

What a wonderful post ! I hope someday, my children will feel this way for us ;)

tracy October 26, 2012 at 1:02 pm

Mr. Wilson! I totally understand your thoughts about ants. I am the ant person in my family.

ALSO. My dad used to harass us kids about turning the lights off when we left a room and I am now that person.

You done good, Mr. Wilson. Your daughter is my favorite.

Sarah Beth October 26, 2012 at 1:31 pm

LOVE this post! You are awesome Joy. (And so is your dad!)

Gerry @ Foodness Gracious October 26, 2012 at 2:42 pm

Love it, being a dad myself makes me a little biased but I hope my kids grow up and have awesome memories of me. Tomorrow I’m going to have them help me make pancakes as per your inspiration :)

Terri October 26, 2012 at 5:06 pm

Joy, the picture is the best! You can see the love you both have in your eyes. My Dad & my daughter’s Dad are both heros to both of us. She now has a daughter of her own but still sends her Dad love texts, calls him when something she sees or hears reminds her of him & it makes his day! I’m so happy that you have such a special relationship with both of your parents. It’s because of their “life’s lessons” that you do. Very happy for you. Cherish every moment.

Lucia October 26, 2012 at 6:54 pm

Loved this post. When I was little my dad worked nights and I could never understand why he got to eat pie for breakfast.
He’s 95 years old now, not doing to well but still enjoying his pie! He loves the grocery store aple pie the best – go figure!
The life lessons I learned from him was never to fear going down a dirt road, usually looking for mushrooms or wild blueberries, because the road will usually end up at a Carvel Ice Cream Store!
Thanks for this post!

Priya Sreeram October 26, 2012 at 11:41 pm

really sweet ! they are one rocking parents I say

Heidi - Apples Under My Bed October 27, 2012 at 1:10 am

This is beautiful. Beautiful.

Susanne October 27, 2012 at 4:48 am

Beautiful….makes me miss my daddy. He died when I was 16 and I cannot believe that I have now lived over half my life without him.

Charlotte October 27, 2012 at 8:17 am

Your mother and I are on the same team and you won’t be able to get one over on us with your child-brain trickery. Did you Mom say no? I say no too.

This is exactly how it was at my house. Incredibly frustrating for a kid who wants something, but now, as an adult, it is amazing to think there was never a time they weren’t a team.

except for curfew. my dad was a little more understanding when i’d come home late.

Claire October 27, 2012 at 9:29 am

Your dad is the bomb.

Erika October 27, 2012 at 12:49 pm

That picture of you and your dad is just the best.

Thanks, as always, for the lovely post.

Candice @ NotesFromABroad October 27, 2012 at 1:13 pm

I loved this. I was reminded of being taken to Dairy Queen on a summer night, in my shorty pyjamas .. what a treat that was ! ( in North Carolina where girls went to Dairy Queen in their pjs )

Jennifer @ Licious Food October 27, 2012 at 3:26 pm

I love this and makes me wish I had/have a Dad like this. I do however have a great Mom.- so that helps.

Lisa October 27, 2012 at 11:46 pm

Oh Joy, I just love these series. this post makes me want to have kids? and one day theyll remember these and write a post about them. My fav is “pie is not pie unless it’s warm”. word.

Maria @ Redecorate Blog October 28, 2012 at 10:42 am

:-) This put the biggest smile on my face. Such sweet dad-isms. Dads are so special, aren’t they?

Madhu October 28, 2012 at 4:54 pm
